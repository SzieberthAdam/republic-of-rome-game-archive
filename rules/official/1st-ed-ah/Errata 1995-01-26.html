<b>Correspondence with Avalon Hill, May 26, 1994:</b>
</p><p>
Q. The rules (7.332) state that for matching wars, for example the 1st and 3rd
Punic Wars, it is allowed to attack the higher-numbered wars as long as all
current lower-numbered wars are also attacked. But what if the lower-numbered
war has a fleet component, e.g. the 1st Punic War:  in that case what is the
minimum that the Senate must attack to permit attacking the higher-numbered war?
</p><blockquote>
	A. It is only necessary to attack the fleet portion of the lower-numbered war,
	i.e. send a minimum of a commander and one fleet to fight the 1st Punic War.

<p>
Rate Pompey a 4.5 Military for Imperial Faction Leader and Crisis Leader.
</p><p>
If the ruling coalition has more governorships than available senators,
allocate governor to faction with fewest overall votes.  They assign
governor normally.  If there is a second, governor, provide to second
fewest overall votes, then third, then first, etc. in rotation.
