<center><h2>Republic of Rome</h2></center>
<center><h3>Clarifications</h3></center>
<center><h3>February 15, 1994</h3></center>

<hr>

<b>3.III Is there only one round of bidding for each additional Initiative?=
</b><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>3.III.4 Can a player appoint a Faction Leader AND sponsor Games in the s=
ame Initiative?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No; "or" means one or the other.</p><p>
<br>
<b>4.7 &amp; 5.2 If a statesman is made a Faction Leader at the start of pl=
ay, does that mean he can not die prior to the appearance of his Family car=
d?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No. A statesman cannot be made Faction Leader until the first Forum =
Phase (4.5). Thereafter, if he were to die, that faction would be without a=
 Faction Leader until the next Forum Phase Initiative provided an opportuni=
ty to name a new one. </p><p>
<br>
<b>5.1 Is a Mortality Chit drawn on the first turn?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>5.1 Are Senators in the Forum (not the Curia) considered "active" and th=
us subject to Mortality Chit draws?  Are Mortality Chits permanently remove=
d when drawn or returned to the cup?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes; Mortality Chits are always returned to the cup at the end of th=
e draw - except for the "draw Two" chits which are returned immediately eve=
n before that draw is concluded. </p><p>
<br>
<b>5.3 If a faction is eliminated, what happens to its cards in hand?</b></=
p><p><b>
</b>A. They are returned to the deck and reshuffled. </p><p>
<br>
<b>5.3 &amp; 9.84 Upon the execution of a Faction leader, can the player im=
mediately appoint a new one, or does he have to wait until Step #4 of the n=
ext Forum Phase?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. The latter.</p><p>
<br>
<b>6.1 Does a captive Senator (10.82) receive personal and/or concession in=
come?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>6.12 After the Calpurnian Law is passed, do the Talents collected from t=
he corrupt Senator go into the state Treasury?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No. They are returned to the Bank.</p><p>
<br>
<b>6.14 Do rebel governors roll for province improvement?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>6.141 Can Bithynia also be improved in the normal way?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>6.22 Do Wars such as the Jugurthine War whose card does not indicate a s=
ubtraction of 20T. still cost the Rome Treasury 20T?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>6.22 &amp; 9.41 Can someone not in Rome be prosecuted?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No. In general, a Senator away from Rome can do nothing in Rome exce=
pt make contributions or sponsor games.</p><p>
<br>
<b>6.22 &amp; 9.64 Can the Senate disband Legions and fleets by refusing to=
 pay maintenance?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No. The only way to disband forces is by passing such a proposal in =
the Senate Phase. If unable to pay maintenance for existing forces, the sta=
te is bankrupt and all players lose (except any declared rebel).</p><p>
<br>
<b>6.3 If the Redistribution of Wealth (III.3) occurs after the collection =
of Personal Revenue (II.1), how can it "make no difference to which Senator=
 of a faction, the money is given at this point?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. The reference to Redistribution of Wealth is to reallocation between=
 Factions. Reallocation of funds between senators of the same Faction is al=
lowed in 6.1 - which happens before such things as Contrubutions.</p><p>
<br>
<b>6.3 Is Faction income distributed sequentially or simultaneously? Can a =
Senator absent from Rome take part in the redistribution? Are previously al=
located funds eligible for reallocation?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Simultaneously. Yes. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>7.2, 7.355, 7.357 Does the exception to "all" DR/dr for initiative mean =
that the random event TDR that follows a "7" initiative DR avoids a "-1" dr=
m? When a Natural Disaster occurs, does the subsequent dr to see which conc=
ession is destroyed have a -1 drm?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>7.31 Does a Statesman take over any Prior Consul marker on its Family ca=
rd? Can a Senator's Popularity go above +9 or below -9?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>7.312 Does a Statesman have a Personal Treasury even though the symbol i=
s not shown on his card? Does Scipio Africanus negate Hannibal and Hamilcar=
 Disaster/Stalemates too or only those of the Punic Wars cards?</b></p><p><=
b>
</b>A. Yes. Only those of the Punic Wars cards - not those of enemy leaders=
. </p><p>
<br>
<b>7.312B If Statesmen 29A and 29B are both in play when the Family card #2=
9 is drawn, who gets it?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. It is placed beneath Statesman 29A.</p><p>
<br>
<b>7.331 Errata: Add "/Fleet" after "Army" in the third line.</b></p><p>
<b>7.332 Errata: Delete "(those with matching illustrations)"</b></p><p><b>
</b>
<br>
<b>7.335 If playing the Early Republic scenario (where the 3rd Punic is not=
 in play), does defeat of the 2nd Punic War reduce the 1st Punic War to a r=
evolt?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>7.34 If a War with a matching leader is defeated, does the leader remain=
 on display in the Curia (subject to an aging dr) if there are still Wars w=
hich match the Leader left in the deck?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>7.341 Is Cleopatra discarded at the end of the turn it is played?</b></p=
><p><b>
</b>A. Yes. It can be played only once, but remains in effect until the Ale=
xandrine War is defeated.</p><p>
<br>
<b>7.37 Is an Intrigue card which is traded outside the Revolution Phase an=
d placed beneath the board edge subject to selection due to the play of the=
 Influence Peddling card?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes, but in this case, it must be returned to the hand prior to the =
random draw and then be returned again to beneath the board edge immediatel=
y afterwards regardless of who owns it.</p><p>
<br>
<b>7.4 May a Senator not in Rome sponsor Games? Can Popularity of a Senator=
 increase beyond 9?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>7.511 Do historically opposed Statesmen belonging to the same Faction st=
ill retain the "+7" for alignment?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>7.511 Is the Flamininus that opposes Cato the Elder and triggers his loy=
alty drop to 0, Statesman 18a (T.Quinctius Flamininus) or the Family card F=
laminius (13)? </b></p><p><b>
</b>A. The former. The loyaltry drop to 0 does not appear on the 18a card b=
ut it should.</p><p>
<br>
<b>9.11 &amp; 9.34 Is the Censor considered the Presiding Magistrate during=
 a Prosecution and thus subject to loss of an influence point if a proposed=
 prosecution is voted down unanimously?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes, however, the prosecutor is not subject to any such influence lo=
ss. </p><p>
<br>
<b>9.22 Can a Senator play a Tribune to make a proposal to adjourn the Sena=
te?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No. Only the Presiding Magistrate may adjourn the Senate?</p><p>
<br>
<b>9.24 &amp; 9.91 Can a Senator refuse to be Master of Horse?</b></p><p><b=
>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>9.34 Does a Senator who forced a proposal to a vote using a Tribune lose=
 influence if the motion is unanimously defeated by the votes of all Senato=
rs of other factions? </b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No - he is not the "Presiding Magistrate". Defeat of his proposal an=
d loss of his Tribune is penalty enough. </p><p>
<br>
<b>9.34 If the HRAO "steps down", does he resign his office or simply pass =
control of the meeting to the next HRAO?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. The latter; he may not become Presiding Magistrate in that turn agai=
n.</p><p>
<br>
<b>9.411 Does a successful Minor Prosecution strip the prosecuted Senator o=
f any office he is currently holding?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>9.412 Can the Censor name himself as Prosecutor?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>9.421 Does an exiled Senator lose negative Popularity also?</b></p><p><b=
>
</b>A. No, he loses only positive Popularity.</p><p>
<br>
<b>9.41 Can the same Senator be prosecuted twice in the same turn if he hel=
d two concessions, or a concession and an office?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>9.423 Does a faction that cast the most votes for an exiled Statesman's =
return and makes a successful Persuasion Attempt vs that Statesman also get=
 the Family card of the Statesman even if it is held by another faction?</b=
></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes - even if that Family card is the Faction Leader.</p><p>
<br>
<b>9.5 Insert: "and Repopulating Rome (9.5)" after "(see 7.5)".</b></p><p>
<b>9.611A In which phase are concessions destroyed by the 2nd Punic War or =
Gladiator Slave Revolt?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. The Senate Phase.</p><p>
<b>9.631 Can you repeal a Type I landbill?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. Yes, but they are rarely repealed because they expire during the nex=
t turn anyway.</p><p>
<b>9.64 Can a Legion or fleet be disbanded and rebuilt in the same Senate P=
hase?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<b>9.64 How is the status of Veteran Legions determined when sending a  for=
ce to oppose a particular war?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. Should the proposal to send forces fail to specify the specific make=
up of those forces, the Commander of the forces may pick which ones to take=
.</p><p>
<b>9.642 Pompey's military rating is rolled before each combat so what is i=
t considered to be when determining his Minimum Force in the Senate Phase?<=
/b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. The minimum value of 2.</p><p>
<b>9.642 &amp; 9.93 Can a Senator refuse an appointment as Master of Horse =
to avoid being sent on a hopeless war with a Dictator who volunteers for th=
e suicide mission?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. He may refuse such appointment.</p><p>
<b>9.67 Can a "Consul for Life" nomination be made without the approval of =
the Presiding Magistrate or use of a Tribune?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<b>9.72 Can a Tribune veto either an appointment or a Dictator's election? =
</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. It can't veto an appointment. It can veto a Dictator's election, but=
 only during its faction's turn to vote.</p><p>
<b>9.8 May a Faction attempt to assassinate one of its own Senators?</b></p=
><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. No. "Opposing" Senators are the only possible targets.</p><p>
<b>9.81, 9.9, 9.91 A Dictator has been appointed and is then assassinated a=
fter appointing his Master of Horse. Can another Dictator be appointed? Wou=
ld the new Dictator get to appoint a new Master of Horse? In the absence of=
 a new Dictator, can the original Master of Horse go to war alone? </b></p>=
<p><b>
<br>
</b>A. Yes - unless the assassination is after the Censor's election. Yes, =
the old Master of Horse would have no duties but may keep his three Influen=
ce gain. Yes.</p><p>
<b>9.83 Are re-rolls for possible capture modified by the played Assassin a=
nd Bodyguard cards?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<b>9.84 If the Faction Leader is the assassin, who is considered the Factio=
n Leader for purposes of the special Major Prosecution?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. No one - nor can a Faction Leader away from Rome be recalled for suc=
h a Prosecution.</p><p>
<b>9.84 If  "neither the Censor nor Prosecutor" is involved in a special Ma=
jor Prosecution, who chooses the voting order?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. The Censor.</p><p>
<b>9.91 Can more than one Dictator election be held if the first is defeate=
d?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. Yes, but unlike Consular elections, there doesn't have to be one ele=
cted; 9.23 doesn't apply.</p><p>
<b>9.92, 10.7 If a Dictator becomes a Proconsul, what happens to his Master=
 of Horse?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. He returns to Rome without office.</p><p>
<b>9.93 If a Dictator and Master of Horse both rebel, may they add their mi=
litary ratings in the Civil War?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. Yes</p><p>
<b>10.12 If Rome sends a naval force with no legions and is victorious in n=
aval combat, must the commander return to Rome or can he remain in the fiel=
d as Pro-Consul to conduct the land war next turn? </b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. He must return to Rome. By being given no legions, he was not entrus=
ted with the conduct of the land war and has no claim to it.</p><p>
<b>10.5 If legions are present and survive a naval battle, does fighting a =
naval battle create a veteran legion?</b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. Yes - if it was at risk in the battle. It can claim veteran status b=
efore any following land battle. </p><p>
<b>10.6 Can the returning legions be used during the same turn elsewhere?</=
b></p><p><b>
<br>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<b>10.72 Errata: The Unrest Level is increased by one at the start of every=
 Population Phase. </b></p><p><b>
<br></b>
<b>10.72 Assume Rome wins a naval victory against the 1st Punic War but doe=
s not wish to pursue a land battle against them in the next turn. Is there =
any way they can avoid an Unprosecuted War penalty?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. The victorious commander could remain as Proconsul in command of at =
least five fleets, but the 20 T. cost of an Active War would still apply.</=
p><p>
<br>
<b>10.82 When a commander is captured, when is the ransom paid?</b></p><p><=
b>
</b>A. Anytime prior to the defeat of the war, except for Barbarian Raids w=
hich must be paid before the next Forum Phase.</p><p>
<br>
<b>10.9 In what order do Multiple Commanders attack their common War?</b></=
p><p><b>
</b>A. The order is determined randomly by die roll.</p><p>
<br>
<b>11.1 May a player discard a Statesman card instead of playing/trading it=
?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>11.51 May the Senate vote to deactivate veteran legions who will otherwi=
se desert to a rebel during the ensuing Combat Phase?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>11.52 Does the rebel Army suffer any losses if the result is "Defeat", b=
ut not "Defeat ALL"?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No. A result of Defeat for the Senate's Army exempts the Rebel Army =
from losses.</p><p>
<br>
<b>12.1A/12.3 Does a Senator who reaches 35 Influence or is elected Consul =
for Life still win if captured by a war on the same turn?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>12.1E A suggested "house rule" to avoid the "end of the world" syndrome =
which occurs when artificial time limits dictate the end of a scenario and =
send all players off on a desperate grab for influence is to continue the g=
ame with the next deck of cards as if playing an extended Campaign Game. Ho=
wever, at the end of every turn starting with the turn the first deck
 expired, a die is rolled to see if the game ends. The game ends on a die r=
oll of 6 or more. There is a +1 modifier for every turn that the die is rol=
led without resulting in the end of the game.</b></p><p><b>
<br>
<b>13.21 May the Pontifex Maximus appoint himself as priest?</b></b></p><p>=
<b><b>
</b></b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>14.2-.3 Are local taxes insufficient to purchase even one unit, and unsu=
pplemented by a Governor or the Senate, simply lost?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>14.4 Do all bracketed provinces immediately lose all taxes even though t=
he War will attack only one per turn?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>14.4 If the Province is in Revolt, does the Active War card pass over th=
at Province and attack the next listed Province remaining loyal to Rome ins=
tead? If the Germanic Migrations win when they are attacked, is Narbonese G=
aul its ally?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes. No - Narbonese Gaul is an open province even while the Migratio=
n remains active.</p><p>
<br>
<b>14.41 The rule says "Provincial Armies". Does it hold true for Fleets as=
 well?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>14.41-.411 The provincial forces increase the strength of the War, but a=
re they still removed at double rate (since there will be no legions backin=
g them up)?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>14.411 Is the printed strength of the Province card which is added to th=
e strength of a victorious War  subject to doubling or tripling for matchin=
g War cards?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>14.413 Does a Governor gain Popularity and Influence for defeat of a Pro=
vincial War?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Yes.</p><p>
<br>
<b>14.6 "Each Provincial Army adds one to the printed strength of the War/P=
rovince card," appears to contradict 14.51. In the case of 14.6, if unaccom=
panied do they only add half? Do they take losses at double the normal rate=
?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No. No. Once Provincial Armies are added to a War card, they cease t=
o be Provincial Armies and are not treated as such.</p><p>
<br>
<b>14.7 Do Provincial Fleets dice for allegiance?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. No.</p><p>
<br>
<b>16.51 Can the player use money to increase his votes as in the regular g=
ame?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. Not for purposes of putting together the ruling coalition.</p><p>
<br>
<b>16.51 Is the tie breaker use of money pertaining to the respective Facti=
on Treasuries, or all the Treasuries of that Faction?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. The latter. </p><p>
<br>
<b>16.56 If the player(s) are the only Factions in the ruling coalition, do=
 they have to use the Military Plans List or can they make their own plan?<=
/b></p><p><b>
</b>A. They can make their own plan. </p><p>
<br>
<b>16.76 When would a Neutral use the blackmail/seduction cards?</b></p><p>=
<b>
</b>A. Automatically when drawn vs whatever faction has the most votes (16.=
51).</p><p>
<br>
<b>CALPURNIAN LAW What happens to a Senator if neither he nor his Faction T=
reasury can pay the fine?=20
</b>A. His Popularity and Influence is reduced by the amount of the shortfa=
ll. </p><p>
<br>
<b>VATINIAN LAW/9.622: When may a Governor governing by legate leave for/re=
turn from his Province?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. He may leave for the Province anytime during the Senate Phase. If he=
 goes to the PProvince he must remain there until the start of the next Sen=
ate Phase or until rerolled. </p><p>
<br>
<b>VATINIAN LAW/14.4: If his Province is attacked in his absence, what mili=
tary rating is used?</b></p><p><b>
</b>A. None.</p><p>
<br>
<b>VATINIAN LAW/14.5: May a Governor rebel with more than one Province or c=
an he choose only one? </b></p><p><b>
</b>A. He can choose only the one in which he is currently residing. All ot=
her Provinces governed by legate return to the Forum for control by the Sen=
ate. </p><p>

</p><p><br>
<b>MATCHING WARS</b></p><p>

<i>No game is perfect. Inevitably, something is omitted that would have mad=
e the game a tad better had only we thought of it in time. Such an instance=
 occurs in REPUBLIC OF ROME
 with respect to rule 7.332. Kirk Schlesing correctly points out that match=
ing wars are allowed to pile up too quickly before the players can do anyth=
ing about it, no matter how cooperative they may wish to be. While the Earl=
y Republic scenario was intended to be difficult to win, we should have tak=
en steps to lessen the effects of a shuffle that brought the 2nd Punic War =
into the game right
 on the heels of the first. We therefore urge all players to incorporate th=
is modification to the rules as an official variation. </i>
</p><p>
<b>7.3321 TIME DELAY:</b> Whenever a War or Revolt card is drawn from the d=
eck that would match a face-up War or Revolt card already located in the Fo=
rum, the drawn card is placed face-down in an Inactive War slot for the rem=
ainder of the current turn. If the face-up matching card is currently locat=
ed in an Inactive War slot, it is immediately moved to an Active War slot; =
otherwise, face-up cards are not affected in any way.=20

At the beginning of each new turn, before any other action is taken, all ca=
rds in Inactive War slots are turned face-up, and one card for each War or =
Revolt is moved to an Active War slot on the Forum. Wars should be selected=
 for activation in chronological order (e.g., 1st Macedonian before 2nd Mac=
edonian, etc) whenever possible.=20

An Inactive War and its Leader are instantly matched and activated; there i=
s no delay. If a Leader is drawn that matches an Active War, the Leader is =
immediately placed on the Active War card, but no additional War cards are =
activated.
</p><p>
</p><p>EXAMPLE: First Punic War begins the game face-up in an Inactive War =
slot. Second Punic War is drawn; it is placed face-down in an Inactive War =
slot, and First Punic War is moved to an Active War slot. Third Punic War i=
s drawn in the same turn; it is placed face-down in an Inactive War slot.
 The Hannibal Leader card is then drawn; it is immediately placed with Firs=
t Punic War. At the start of Turn 2, Second Punic War is moved
 to an Active War slot, but Third Punic War remains Inactive until the star=
t of Turn 3. If the Hamilcar Leader card is drawn during either turn, it wo=
uld be placed with an Active Punic War card. Third Punic War would remain I=
nactive.=20
</p><p>
This rule allows Rome at least one opportunity to attack with a reasonable =
chance of success before its strength multiplies without resorting to extra=
ordinary measures such as a Dictator.=20
