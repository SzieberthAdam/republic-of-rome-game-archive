Subject: More RoR Q&amp;A (from General mag)

Question Box, The General, 27(4), 1991.
 
3.III There is only one round of bidding for each initiative.
 
4.7 A Statesman can not be made Faction Leader until the first Forum Phase.
 
5.1 Senators in the Forum (not the Curia) are considered "active", and thus
subject to Mortality Chit draws.  Mortality Chits are always returned to the
cup at the end of each draw, apart from "Draw 2" chits which are returned
immediately, before drawing another chit in the same draw.  A Mortality
Chit is drawn on the first turn.
 
5.2 A Statesman who is also Faction Leader is killed by a matching mortality
chit, even if the matching family card is not present.  In this case the
faction has to wait until the next Forum Phase intiative to appoint a new
faction leader.
 
5.3 The player must wait until his or her next Forum Phase initiative before
making the senator the Faction Leader.
 
6.1 A captive senator does not receive personal or concession income.
 
6.3 Faction income is distributed simultaneously.  Senators absent from 
Rome can take part in the redistribution.  Previously allocated funds may
be reallocated.
 
7.312 A Statesman has a personal treasury, even though the symbol is not
shown on the card.
 
7.37 An Intrigue card that is traded outside the Revolution Phase is subject
to selection due to the play of the Influence Peddling card.  It must be
returned to the hand before the random draw, and then immediately returned to
beneath the board edge, regardless of who now owns it.
 
7.4 Senators not in Rome may sponsor Games.
 
9.412 The Prosecutor does not suffer any ill-effects if a Prosecution is
unanimously rejected.
 
9.22 A Senator may not play a Tribune to make a proposal to adjourn the Senate.
 
9.84 The player must wait until his or her next Forum Phase initiative before
appointing a new Faction Leader.
