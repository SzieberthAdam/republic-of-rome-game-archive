Governor Revolt Errata/Addendum - Version 2

1. The primary rebel can keep any veteran legions owing allegiance to
a non-rebel senator in his army (if he successfully rolls for their
loyalty); however, a non-rebel senator _may_ order his legions to
desert to the senate's army immediately before any combat roll is made
against the rebel. The rebel must maintain any such legions unless he
returns control of them to the senate during the revenue phase.

Strategy: A rebel might want to do this in the hope that the non-rebel
senator dies before the senate attacks the rebel since in this case
the legion would become unaligned. He might also want to do this so
that one of his own senators does not need to rebel; his non-rebel
senator can then refuse to order his legion to the Senate's army before
combat.

2. A rebel's aligned legion joins the primary rebel's army if, and only
if, the legion is in Rome and the primary rebel is in Italy during the
Senate or Revolution Phase.

Example: Caesar as victorious commander declares himself in Revolt. He
is immediately considered to be in Italy. Any legions of his currently
in Rome would join his army. Any of his legions in a province can only
join his force when that province reinforces his army.

Strategy: The Senate should try to keep a rebel's aligned legions away
from Rome either garrisoning a loyal province or fighting a foreign war
under a loyal commander; since otherwise the legion would join the
primary rebel's army if he were in Italy, thereby increasing the rebel
army's strength. 

3. Rebel governors (including secondary rebels) keep control of their
province. Personal, state, and local income from a province is added
directly to that governor's personal treasury. A governor's personal
treasury can be used to maintain his or the primary rebel's forces.

4. The primary rebel can utilize the personal treasuries of any
secondary rebel. A secondary rebel cannot utilize another rebel's
personal treasury.

5. A rebel's faction treasury can be used by any rebel to maintain his
forces.

6. A rebel province is never considered under attack by any wars in
play. It always generates revenue; however it cannot be developed.

7. Garrison legions in a province of a secondary rebel are returned to
Rome when the governor declares himself in rebellion unless the legion
is a veteran aligned to any rebel.

8. If Rome attacks a rebel while he is in his province, the rebel's
land strength is equal to the sum of his:
	Printed Land Strength
	Provincial Armies (count half if no legions in province)
	Veteran Legions Owing Allegiance/Garrison Legions
	Military Rating of Rebel
The rebel's fleet support strength is equal to the sum of:
	Printed Fleet Strength
	Provincial Fleets
        Roman Fleets
If the number of Provincial and Roman fleets exceeds the undeveloped
printed land strength of the province (even if the province is
developed), a naval battle must be fought first; unless the maximum
number of fleets that province can build is 0. The Rebel's naval
strength would be equal to the sum of his:
        Printed Fleet Strength
        Provincial Fleets
        Roman Fleets
        Military Rating of Rebel

9. On any revolution phase following the one in which the rebel states
that he is marching on Rome, a secondary rebel governor may attempt
to reinforce the rebel's main army with any forces he currently has.
The reinforcements are automatically added to the primary rebel's army
if that province has a printed fleet strength of 0. If the province
has a printed fleet strength greater than 0 then the reinforcements
are considered to be "in transit". Reinforcements "in transit" are
added to the primary rebel's army only if it avoids Naval Interception
during next combat phase. Only one secondary rebel may reinforce the
primary rebel each turn. A province which has already reinforced the
primary rebel or has forces "in transit" may not build any new forces.
The governor continues to gain personal, state, and local income.

10. If a primary rebel governor does not march on Rome on the turn that
he declares his revolt and the province has a printed fleet strength
greater than 0; the Senate can prevent the rebel from landing in Italy
by Naval Interception. The rebel would be considered "in transit"

11. The senate cannot attack a rebel province if that province has
already transported forces to Italy or has forces "in transit". Once a
province has transported an army to Italy, that province cannot build
any new forces or transport any forces to Italy, though the governor
must still maintain it's printed strength. A province whose army is
"in transit" also cannot build any new forces.

12. A province's printed fleet strength is used in Naval Interception
battles; All Naval Interception battles are resolved before any other
battles are during the Combat Phase. Provincial fleets are always
counted at full strength unlike provincial armies.

13. A Victorious Commander who revolts can dice for the loyalty of his
Roman fleets if he has any.

14. Battles against rebels never affect the Unrest Level, but a
victorious commander gains popularity and influence equal to half the
strength of the force he defeats, not including the military rating of
the rebel senator. If the primary rebel is defeated, all secondary
rebels are killed and their provinces are returned to the Forum
undeveloped. All provincial units belonging to these provinces are 
eliminated.

15. If a secondary rebel who is also a governor dies. His province
returns to the Forum undeveloped and all provincial units of that
province are eliminated if they are currently in the province. If a
primary rebel dies, the rebellion is defeated and all secondary rebels
are killed as well.

16. If the Vatinian Law is in effect, only one province (governor's
choice) belonging to the rebel (whether primary or secondary) may
revolt or join in the revolt. A governor must be in his province in
order for that province to revolt. All other provinces that the rebel
is ruling through Legate are returned to the Forum but are otherwise
unaffected (all forces remain, etc...) since they are considered to
remain loyal to Rome.

17. If the senate sends a force to attack the rebel in his province,
they are subject to desertion to the rebel if the rebel's force
includes _any_ legions. Battles involving a rebel may create veteran
legions that owe allegiance to their commander. It is therefore
possible that a non-veteran garrison legion could become a veteran
legion owing allegiance to the rebel therefore requiring no future
maintenance for the rebel.

18. If the Senate does not send a force to attack a primary rebel
governor in revolt who is _not_ marching on Rome, that revolt becomes
Unprosecuted and increases the unrest level by 1 during the next
Population Phase.

Example: If Governor Caesar declares himself in revolt on turn 4 and the
Senate does not send a force to attack him in his province on turn 5,
then the revolt is considered Unprosecuted and will increase the Unrest
Level during turn 6's Population Phase.

19. A Governor in revolt who is _not_ marching on Rome can win the
game if a People Revolt or Bankruptcy occurs.

20. The Senate cannot disband a veteran legion that is aligned with a
rebel.
