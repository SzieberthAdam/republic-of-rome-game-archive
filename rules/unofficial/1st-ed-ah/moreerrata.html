Unofficial Errata - By Roberto Ullfig

--- Statesman
M. Fulvius Flaccus - He may claim the Land Commissioner Concession only
during the Senate Phase any time after Prosecutions (he may claim it
before Governorships). He can only claim the card if there is a Land Bill
in effect at the time.

C. Pompeius Magnus - When first played, roll a dr to determine his
military rating (used for determining minimum force 9.642). Roll again
before every combat roll that he is involved in to determine his new
military rating.

L. Licinius Lucullus - His special ability is in effect only when he is
not a Governor. If he "must" be recalled, then he automatically returns
to Rome immediately after all required Senate actions next turn (after
prosecutions and vacant governorships have been assigned). If the combat
result is a standoff, a veteran legion is not created (unless he is a
governor). A standoff still prevents a province from being attacked by
the war in question.

C. Julius Caesar - Creates 2 Veteran Legions as a victorious Governor as
well.

--- Events
Rhodian Maritime Alliance - The fleets are disbanded at the end of the
Combat Phase in which the current War (active or inactive) requiring the
most fleets (Fleet Support Number + Modified Fleet Strength) is defeated.
The card can only be rejected by the Senate on the turn of the card's
appearance, in which case the fleets are immediately returned. The card
remains in the Forum until either rejected or the defeated War condition
is met. If there are two wars requiring the most fleets then defeat of
one of the wars will end the alliance.

Trial of Verres - Personal income can only be reduced to a minimum of 0;
the state should not have to pay more as a result of this event.

--- Wars
Germanic Migrations - Narbonese Gaul is created during the Combat phase
only if the war is attacked by a non-Governor commander.

Social War - Does not activate inactive Wars that do not have a matching
War _listed_ on the card, such as Invasion of Britain, Invasion of
Germany and Parthian War.

2nd Cilician Pirates - Apparently, text was cut off card. Defeat of this
War should create Crete-Cyrene. Assume that it is _not_ considered a
revolt if Crete-Cyrene is already in play (due to bequest). Attack order
also is missing, assume it is: [Attacks: Crete-Cyrene, Cilicia-Cyprus].

--- Provinces
Bithynia/Bithynia-Pontus - Bithynia-Pontus can be created by normal
development of Bithynia or by defeat of the 3rd Mithridatic War. Wars
that attack Bithynia-Pontus also attack Bithynia.

Crete-Cyrene - is created by either Ptolemy-Apion Bequest or defeat of
2nd Cilician Pirates.

--- Laws
Vatinian Law - (change to official errata) A governor may return to Rome
only during the Revenue Phase. A governor may leave Rome to a province at
any time during the Senate Phase; for purposes of voting treat the
governor as if he had died (see errata for 9.82 below). A corrupt
governor becomes honest (with respect to a particular province) at the
end of a senate phase in which he was successfully prosecuted or fined.
A governor whose term expires does not have to return to Rome unless he
is in the province whose term has expired.

Manilian Law - If a commander moves his force to an inactive War that War
becomes active immediately. Note that a commander who uses this Law's
power becomes a Proconsul in all respects and can therefore be recalled
by the Senate.

--- Forum Phase

7.312 This should read as Condition A _or_ Condition B.

7.312B A Family card is considered _not_ in play (and _not_ controlled by
a faction) if it is under a statesman, so a related statesman _can_ be
played in this case.

7.332 Wars with same picture _do_ match. In crontradiction with the first
Official Errata. So, Numantine, Sertorian, Spanish Revolt, and Viriathus
all match. Syrian and Alexandrian also match. Note though, that Spartacus
has a different picture than the Slave Revolts, though they all match,
and that Antiochus (Cleopatra) does not match Alexandrian (Syrian) War.

7.35 Provincial Forces, during a Pretender Event, function just like
Provincial Forces on a War card for purposes of strength and taking
losses.

7.372 Add "anything having to do with agreeing (not) to rebel" to the
list of open deals that cannot be enforced.

7.511 The Gracchi brothers have a loyalty of 0 when they are on DIFFERENT
factions, not on the same faction, as it works for other statesmen.

--- Senate Phase

9.24 A Dictator cannot be nominated as Consul but a Master of Horse can.

9.34 The Censor loses one influence whenever a prosecution is defeated by
unanimous vote. He does not have the option of stepping down.

9.41 The prosecutor in a successful Major prosecution does not gain any
influence. A prosecutor can only gain influence for a successful minor
prosecution.

9.44 The Popular Appeal should be re-worded. All positive votes gained are
considered votes "against" the proposal, all negative votes are considered
votes "for" the proposal. The player rolling must add the results of the
roll to his vote.

9.611 Grain concessions are destroyed at the start of the Senate Phase
just like Tax Farmer concessions are. They may return to the Forum even
if the War that destroyed them is still active; though they would be
destroyed again at the start of the next Senate Phase.

9.627 All provinces must have a governor at the end of the Senate Phase.
If a governor dies during the Senate Phase (after all open governorships
have been assigned) the Senate must elect a new governor at the earliest
opportunity. If a governor dies during a proposal sending the PM away
from Rome, then that proposal is suspended until a new governor is
elected. This rule should only occur when the Vatinian Law is in effect
or a governor is recalled to face an Assassination Prosecution since a
governor away from Rome cannot die during the Senate Phase.

9.67 Consul for Life cannot be proposed while the Censor is Presiding
Magistrate during Prosecutions. As soon as a Censor is elected he becomes
the Presiding Magistrate.

9.82 If a senator which is to be one of the recipients of a proposal dies
during the vote, that proposal is voided and any Tribune played to
initiate the proposal is lost. If the Presiding Magistrate dies, the vote
continues with the next HRAO acting as Presiding Magistrate. If the
Prosecutor dies, the prosecution is voided but still counts towards the
Censor's limit. If the Censor dies during the Prosecution step, the
current prosecution is voided and no more prosecutions are possible.
A senator's vote is counted even if he is dead by the end of the vote (as
long as he voted before he died). A Special Assassination Prosecution
only temporarily suspends the current proposal; the proposal continues
after the prosecution is resolved, if possible. A Land Bill vote is never
voided by the death of a senator, whether he is sponsor or co-sponsor.

9.84 A caught Faction Leader/Assassin is killed; the faction leader
marker is removed and Mortality chits are drawn for his faction as if he
was found guilty. His faction must assign a new faction leader during his
next Forum phase.

9.84 A Faction Leader, not in Rome, of a caught assassin is immediately
recalled to face a Major Prosecution. A Governor can be recalled in this
instance even if he left for a province during the current Senate phase.
Commanders cannot be recalled though Proconsuls can. [ Don't know about
this one; AH says there is no auto recall but this would make
Assassinations too powerful. Commanders should not be able to be recalled
because this would mess up prosecution of matching wars.]

9.92 The Master of Horse must also surrender his office when Consuls are
elected.

--- Combat Phase

10.11 The points added by both the Dictator and Master of Horse combined
cannot be greater than the strength of the army.

10.5 Veteran Legions are not created in Naval Battles.

10.81 Governors can be captured by Barbarian Raids as in 10.82.

10.82 Captives lose all income and have their personal treasuries frozen
(except for purposes of paying ransom). Ransom money can be pooled
between the Captive's personal treasury and his faction treasury. A
Captive always keeps his original office. A captive Governor loses
his office(s) unless the Vatinian Law is in effect _and_ he is ransomed
before provinces roll for income and development. Captives always return
to Rome when ransomed; they are killed if the war is discarded _or_
returned to the deck. A Captive's influence does not count towards that
faction's total for purposes of victory.

--- Victory Conditions

12.31 Consul for Life takes over all factions (except for the faction
belonging to a player who currently has a rebel senator) and plays them
as if they were his own. He can use any and all cards these players have
(i.e. he can look at their cards). Note that players will regain control
of their factions if the CFL dies in combat, but not if he is captured.

--- Pontifex Maximus

13.2 A Pontifex Maximus may not assign himself a priest but a senator who
already has a priest may be elected as Pontifex Maximus (though he loses
his Priest if elected). He can veto any proposal the rules normally allows
him to.

13.4 The Pontifex Maximus' Veto can be used against any proposal that
can normally be vetoed. He is not relegated to using it only against war
proposals.

--- Provincial Forces

14.4 In the Advanced Game, Provinces under attack from a War card cannot
develop; only the first existing province listed within brackets on the
war card is effected. Also, only the first province loses all taxes and
cannot build forces.

14.4 A Province that was just created in the current Combat Phase due to
a War being defeated is not considered under attack until the next turn.
For example if both the 3rd Punic War and the Jugurthine are active and
the 3rd Punic War is defeated but the Jugurthine is not attacked; the
Jugurthine will not attempt to conquer Africa until next turn.

14.4 If required, a province must win the naval battle before it can
attack a war's land strength. In this case, the province's naval strength
is equal to its printed fleet strength plus all it fleets.

14.411  Note that if a Roman Force suffers a Disaster against a War, that
War will attempt to conquer a province even though the War is considered
Prosecuted. There would be no change to the Unrest Level in this case
other than that caused by the original Disaster. If the province becomes
allied with the War, the printed land strength of the province is added
to the land strength of the war. The printed _fleet_ strength of the
province is added to the _fleet support_ strength of the war. Provincial
forces increase the strength of the land strength and the _fleet support_
strength. If the war has a _fleet_ strength, then the province's printed
_fleet_ strength and fleets are added to the war's _fleet_ strength as
well.

14.411 It is possible that a War can become "unattackable" (especially in
the East) after it has conquered several provinces due to the Fleet
Support strength becoming greater than 25 (Rome can never have more than
25 Fleets). Allow Rome to attack such a war as long as it sends 25 Fleets
as support but for each Fleet less than that required, subtract one from
the Combat TDR. [House Rule]

14.412 A Province's forces (even if they contain Roman Legions) cannot be
used to satisfy a War's Prosecuted status. A Disaster is treated as "no
effect" other than the loss of any called for forces and the resulting
mortality check for the governor. The total force not including the
printed strength of the province is used in order to determine the number
of units lost in a Disaster/Standoff.

14.413 AH Errata states that a victorious governor gains popularity and
influence as per a normal war (1/2 strength rounded up). Since a victory
by a governor doesn't discard the war, it would make more sense if the
gain should only be 1/4 strength rounded up. [House Rule]

14.413 A Provincial Victory does not create provinces, generate spoils,
or effect the Unrest Level.

14.511 If the number of fleets (Provincial plus Roman but not including
the printed fleet strength) in the province is greater than the printed
land strength of the province's undeveloped side (even if the province
is developed), then a naval battle must be fought first; however, if the
maximum number of fleets a province can build is 0 a naval battle is
never fought. The naval strength is equal to the sum of all fleets plus
printed fleet strength and military rating of governor (if applicable).

--- Proposal Suspension

There are two cases in which a proposal can be suspended:
1. A tribune is played (or a governor killed) during a proposal sending
the PM away from Rome.
2. An Assassination Prosecution (AP) is required.
In both cases, the current state of the proposal is saved, so that any
votes made prior to the suspension cannot be changed, etc...
A proposal that suspends another proposal can itself be suspended by an
AP; however an AP can _never_ be suspended; Further APs are resolved
after the current one is completed. A proposal that suspends a proposal
sending the PM away from Rome can in no way alter the state of the game
so that the original proposal would be voided if the new proposal passed
(i.e. the new proposal could not propose to send the PM away from Rome or
to disband units that the original proposal requires, etc...).

Example: Player A makes a proposal to send the PM away to fight a war.
Player B plays a Tribune to nominate one of his senators Consul for Life
(CFL). Since the CFL proposal would _not_ prevent the PM from being sent
to fight the war if it passes, this proposal is valid and suspends the
war proposal. Player C attempts to assassinate the CFL nominee and is
caught; an Assassination Prosecution now suspends the CFL proposal. After
the AP is resolved, the vote for CFL continues, after which the war
proposal continues.

--- Proposal Implementation Timing

A proposal is implemented as soon as the last faction votes on it (and
the proposal passes). No cards can be played or actions occur between the
time the last faction votes and the proposal is implemented. In other
words, the passage of a proposal coincides with the implementation of
that proposal. (Example: a senator could not be assassinated after he is
elected governor since he is considered to be in his province as soon as
the proposal passes).
