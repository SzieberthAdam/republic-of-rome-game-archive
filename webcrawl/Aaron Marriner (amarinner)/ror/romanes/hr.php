HOUSE RULES (v1.3 - Last Updated: 03/04/2004)
Game Name : Romanes Eunt Domus
Scenario  : Middle Republic. For experienced Republic of Rome players only.
Start Date: February 23, 2004
Players   : 5

GM        : Aaron Marriner : ror (at) amarriner (dot) com

GAME SUMMARIES: All turn reports and summaries will be sent via email to
all the players and observers. I will also keep a text log of the current
status and game history located at: http://www.amarriner.com/ror/romanes/
Everything will be posted at Redscape as well.

DEADLINES: All orders must be submitted to me via the email above.
Deadlines for phases will be at least 72 hours. The only exception to that
rule is that a deadline will not fall on a Saturday or Sunday. If that
occurs, the deadline will be pushed to the following Monday. All orders
are due at 4:30pm GMT.

RULES: We will be using and following the Living Rules document as 
closely as possible. It is located at:
http://67.66.187.69/ror/index.htm

OPTIONAL RULES:
13. Pontifex Maximus

NEGOTIATIONS: All negotiations between factions will occur via email. You
must CC me on all conversations so I can keep an archive of the messages.
All public communication will occur on the redscape forums
(www.redscape.net) which also means that each player must have an account
there (it's free).  Nothing in the public forum is considered binding
unless specified by me.

ORDERS: Send all orders in separate emails. Meaning, do not send orders
for more than one phase in a single email. Label all orders with 'ROR PBEM
Romanes - &lt;phase&gt; (&lt;faction&gt;)' in the subject line. 

For example: ROR PBEM Romanes - Censor Vote (Moon)

All orders are considered FINAL unless you tell me otherwise.

NMR: If your orders are not in by the deadline, you will forfiet that
turn. For votes you will abstain and for all other actions you will do
nothing. If you NMR three times, I reserve the right to replace you. If
you send orders after the deadline but before I process the turn your
orders will be accepted.
