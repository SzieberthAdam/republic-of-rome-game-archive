--- Mortality Roll (instead of drawing chits)

Roll a 36 sided dice (by e-mail of course):

1-30   =  Appropriate Senator Dies
31-34  =  No Death
35-36  =  Roll two more times (ad infinitum)

You must keep track by hand which numbers are rolled; except for 35-36,
ignore a roll that duplicates a previous roll (i.e. roll again).
