<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Updated May 19,
2008 - sections noted below in red.</span><br>
<h1>2.2 Provincial Forces</h1>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
2.2.1 OVERVIEW</span>: A Governor must raise Provincial Forces which
may be used to defend the Province against Wars.<br>
</font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
2.2.2 PROVINCE STATE</span>: There are four states in which a Province
can be in:<br>
1. Roman Province - controlled by the Senate; may or may not currently
have a Governor.<br>
2. Rebel Province - controlled by a Rebel Senator.</font></font><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif"><br>
3. Ally Province - a Province Defeated by a War card joins it as an
Ally.</font></font><br>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif">4. War
Province - a Province can be converted to an independant War card by
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interal Disorder</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Pretender </span>Events.<br>
<br>
</font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.3 TAXES</span>: The Personal and State
income derived from Roman Provinces remains the same as in the Basic
Game. However, an additional annual Local Tax income is generated
during the Revenue Phase for use strictly within that Province for the
formation of Provincial forces. Local Taxes may be supplemented by the
Governor, but never decreased or stolen. All Local Taxes are considered
used each year during the Revenue Phase in building the maximum amount
of Provincial Forces that Province can raise as defined on the Province
card after &#8220;Maximum Forces:&#8221;. A Rebel Province collects ALL Taxes for
use in both maintaining and building Forces. A War Province collects
ALL Taxes for use only in building new Forces. An Ally Province does
not collect income.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.4 FORCES</span>: Provincial Armies
and Fleets are raised by the Governor (Roman or Rebel) at the end of
the Revenue Phase. Units so raised are indicated by placement of a
proper number marker on their Province Card in either the Provincial
Armies or Fleets boxes. It costs ten Talents to build each Army or
Fleet. The Governor may choose which type to build. An unaligned
Governor (1.09.53) will build Provincial Armies/Fleets in equal
proportions (Armies getting preference in the case of odd numbers). A
War Province will build new Forces to the extent of its income. An Ally
Province will never build any Forces.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.41 VETERANS</span>: Provincial
Armies do not produce Veterans; however, Roman Garrison Legions may be
converted to Veteran status per normal rules. They become aligned to
the Governor of the Province.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.42 GARRISONS</span>: The Senate
(by passing a proposal) may send Legions and/or Fleets to a Roman
Province to serve as a Garrison to stiffen a Provincial Force.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.43 ARMY STRENGTH</span>:
Provincial Armies in a Roman/Rebel Province are counted at full
strength as long as at least one Roman Legion accompanies them at the
start of battle. Otherwise, Provincial Armies count at half strength
(fractions rounded up). Note that the Base Strength of the Province is
never halved. Provincial Fleets are always counted at full strength.
Provincial Armies in an Ally/War Province are always counted at full
strength.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.44 MAINTENANCE</span>: Provincial
forces are freely maintained in a Roman Province. Garrison
Legions/Fleets in a Roman Province require maintenance by the Senate.
All forces in a Rebel Province must be maintained by the Rebel Governor
but he has access to ALL Taxes (Personal, State, and Local). Forces in </font></font><font

the Forum during the Combat Phase for any reason do not participate in
combat that turn. <span style="font-weight: bold;">[Mar 7 2007]</span></font></font><font

Province must now attack the War card plus any Matching Wars with a
Base Strength equal to that printed on its Province card (plus any
existing Provincial forces and/or Garrisons also on the Province card)
and the Military Rating of its Governor. All Provincial and Garrison
fleets must be fully committed to battle if available even if they are
not necessary. If the Province does not have the required Fleet support
to attack a War card, the attack is still resolved but any &#8220;Victory&#8221;
result&nbsp; is converted to a &#8220;Stalemate&#8221;. Combat is resolved in the
normal fashion, except for Losses (2.2.52). If the Province has 0 Army
Strength and is required to fight a Land Battle or 0 Fleet Strength and
is required to fight a Naval Battle, then the battle is an automatic
Defeat. </font></font><font color="#000000"><font

 style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.52 TAKING LOSSES</span>: Provincial
Armies in a Roman/Rebel Province take losses in Combat at double the
normal rate unless a Legion is present and survives the battle.
Otherwise, losses are taken equally from Armies and Legions (and
Provincial Fleets/Roman Fleets). Randomly determine which units are
lost in the best method you deem possible.</font></font><br>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.521 DEFEAT</span>: A &#8220;Defeat&#8221; in
any type of battle results in the death of the Governor. The Province
becomes an Ally Province allied with the victorious War, combining with
it to increase the strength of the War by the printed Strength of the
Province card. Any surviving Provincial forces are also added to the
War card, and any surviving Roman forces are returned to Rome. Because
this was a Provincial Defeat rather than a Roman Defeat the Unrest
Level is not affected. The surviving Provincial forces increase the
Strength of the War card by one for each Army/Fleet. </font></font><font

Fleets added to a War card due to a
Provincial Defeat only increase that War's Fleet Support strength
unless the War requires a Naval Victory (i.e. both Cilician Pirates) in
which case both Fleet Support strength and Naval Strength are
increased. If the rare case that the Fleet Support strength of a war
exceeds 25, Rome must win a Naval Battle first before attacking the
War's land strength. A Roman Naval Victory will always eliminate all
Provincial Fleets on the War card.&nbsp;</span> <span

<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.531 STALEMATE</span>: A result of
&#8220;Stalemate/Standoff&#8221; is treated as no effect other than the loss of any
called for Provincial forces and the resulting Mortality Check for the
Governor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.2.541 VICTORY</span>: A result of
&#8220;Victory&#8221; in a land battle turns the War card into an Inactive War if
there are presently no activating matching Wars/Leaders in the Forum
(thus it does not incur an Unprosecuted war&nbsp;penalty during the
Population Phase). It will stay inactive until attacked by Rome or made
active by another matching war or leader. If there is a matching
War/Leader in the Forum, the defeated War is reshuffled into the deck.
If the current deck has less than six cards, and there is another deck
to be used in an extended game, shuffle it into the next deck instead.
If the current deck has less than six cards, and the extended game is
not being played or the game is on the last deck, discard it (a
Province is not created in this case). A Provincial Victory has no
effect on the Unrest Level and never creates spoils of war. A result of
&#8220;Victory&#8221; in a naval battle results in a Naval Victory marker being
placed on the war and if the War has no Land Strength then it is
defeated as well. A Provincial Naval Victory places the War in a
Prosecuted State if it isn't already.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font

<h1>2.3 Rebel Governors</h1>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
2.3.1 OVERVIEW</span>: A Governor may use his Provincial Forces and
Garrison Legions to revolt against the Senate either as a Primary or
Secondary Rebel.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Vatinian Law</span>: If this law is in
effect, only one of the Governor's Provinces may revolt; his other
Provinces remain loyal to Rome and are immediately returned to the
Forum. The Governor must be residing in the Province in order for that
Province to revolt. Note that he can move to one of his Provinces at
any time during the Senate Phase when this law is in effect - in
preparation for a revolt in the upcoming Revolution Phase.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.2&nbsp; REVOLT</span>:
Any
Governor may use his Province in a revolt against the state by
declaring so during the Revolution Phase. Revolt declarations by
Governors are made at the same time as the revolt declarations by
Victorious Commanders. As per the standard Revolution rules, there may
only be one Rebel Faction (eligible to win). Should a Faction that
wishes to revolt field a stronger total force than that of a
previously declared Faction, the initial rebel's declaration is
ignored, and the Faction with the stronger revolt force is considered
in revolt instead. A Faction's total revolt force is equal to the
Primary Rebel's Military Rating plus all Provincial Armies and Legions
loyal to both Primary and Secondary Rebels in that Faction. Provincial
Armies are always loyal to a Governor. All Legions in a Province
belonging to a Primary Rebel Governor are loyal to him. All Rebel
Aligned Veteran
Legions (RAVL) are also loyal to the revolt even if they
are currently not under the command of a rebel; however, they may not
be able to immediately join the Primary Rebel's army. A Primary Rebel
Governor may remain in his Province or March on Rome but must declare
his decision at the time of the revolt. In a subsequent Revolution
Phase he may declare that he is attempting to March on Rome but once
landed he must remain in Italy until defeated or victorious. </font></font><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif">The revolt counts
as one of the four Active
Wars needed to destroy Rome and costs the State 20 Talents per turn
whether or not the Primary Rebel is Marching on Rome.</font></font><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif"><br>
<br>
</font></font><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.21 SECONDARY REBELS</span>:
Only the Primary Rebel's army may land in Italy to
attack the Senate during the first Combat Phase after a revolt is
declared. Other Senators belonging to the
same faction that
join the revolt as Secondary Rebels in support of the Primary Rebel may
add no forces other
than <font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif">Rebel
Aligned Veteran
Legions (RAVL)</font></font> under their command at this time. On each
subsequent turn that the Rebellion exists; an
rebel Governor of his Faction may attempt to add his forces
to those of the Primary Rebel's army as reinforcements.
Those Armies/Legions that he can land in Italy (see 2.3.5) will
reinforce the rebel army. Senators from opposing factions may not
declare
themselves Secondary Rebels.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.22 REBEL PROVINCES AND WARS<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">/EVENTS</span>:</span>
A rebel Province is never considered under attack by any wars in play
(the wars simply ignore them). A rebel Province always generates
revenue; however it cannot be developed.<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> A rebel Province is not affected by
any Random Events.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.23 REBEL GOVERNOR INCOME</span>: A
Governor in revolt is not subject to recall and loses all Offices,
Concessions, Knights, Priests, and Senatorial income assigned to him.
He keeps all money in his Personal Treasury. He does not collect any
income except from his Province of which he collects ALL income
(Personal, State, and Local Taxes - he must roll to determine Personal
and State Income and must subtract negative results from his total
income) for use in maintaining and building military forces in his
Province or maintaining forces in the Primary Rebel's army. These funds
are placed in his Personal Trreasury.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.24 REBEL FORCE MAINTENANCE</span>:
Each Provincial Army/Fleet, Garrison Legion/Fleet, and Province Base
Strength point requires two Talents to maintain. <font color="#000000"><font
 face="Arial Unicode MS, serif">Rebel Aligned Veteran
Legions (RAVL)</font></font> require no maintenance. A Rebel Governor
pays
maintenance using Talents from his Personal Treasury and/or his Faction
Treasury. A Rebel Governor must first pay to maintain his Province's
printed Base Strength. If he does not have enough funds to maintain
even the Base Strength of the Province then he simply spends all money
in his Personal Treasury and need not spend any funds from his Faction
Treasury; but he must in this case disband all Provincial forces in the
Province (or "in transit" see 2.3.51)
that require maintenance - Rebel Legions/Fleets are returned to Rome.
After maintaining his Province's Base
Strength, a Governor maintains Provincial Army/Fleet and Garrison
Legion/Fleet units in his Province (or "in transit" see 2.3.51). He may
also build new Provincial
Forces if he has spare funds and the Province's Maximum Force Size has
not yet been attained. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span><span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">A
Rebel Governor
may voluntarily refuse to maintain some or all Forces in his
Province (disbanding Provincial units and returning Roman units to
Rome). </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">Note that a Primary Rebel
may use any funds in a Secondary Rebel's Personal Treasury as if they
were his own. A Secondary Rebel Governor could disband all Provincial
Units in his province and keep all of that Province's income in his
Personal Treasury (after maintaining the Province's Base Strength).
Such money could then be used by the Primary Rebel to help finance his
own Force. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">[Mar 6 2007]</span>&nbsp; </span>A
Rebel Governor must maintain as many of his forces as possible. He may
not disband any of his forces (unless he is forced to if he is
under-funded). <span style="font-weight: bold;">[May 19 2008]</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.25 REBEL PROVINCIAL ARMY STRENGTH</span>:
Provincial Armies are counted at full strength as long as at least one
Legion starts the battle with them. Otherwise, Provincial Armies count
half (fractions rounded up). Provincial Fleets are always counted at
full strength.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="RAVL"></a>2.3.26 REBEL
ALIGNED VETERAN LEGIONS
(RAVL)</span>:<br>
a. If a Primary Rebel Marches on Rome on the same turn that his revolt
is declared, all RAVL under the command of Secondary Rebels (Commanders
or Governors) as well as those currently in Rome are immediately added
to his army.<br>
b. If a Primary Rebel does not immediately March on Rome all RAVL
remain in their present location except that all Legions (including
RAVL) under
the command of a non-Governor Secondary Rebel are returned to Rome. If
the Primary Rebel Marches on Rome on a later turn only those RAVL in
Rome at that time will be added to his army; <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">however, if the Rebel must avoid Naval
Interception in order to land in Italy such legions are only added to
his army if the Senate fails to intercept.</span> RAVL under the
command of
Secondary Rebel Governors can only be added via Reinforcement (2.3.51).<br>
c. RAVL under the command of Loyal Commanders (fighting another war) or
Loyal Governors are never added to the Pimary Rebel's army; however if
a RAVL is ever in a Senate Army facing
a Rebel<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> (Primary or Secondary)</span>
they desert to the Rebel<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> </span>before
battle. [The Senate might deem
it prudent to send RAVL under its control to
Garrison Loyal Provinces to prevent them from joining a Rebel army].<br>
d. RAVL do not require maintenance if they are under a Rebel's command
but if the RAVL's Senator (a Secondary Rebel) dies they revert to being
normal Veteran
Legions whose maintenance must be paid for. <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Such legions remain rebel legions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">[Feb 27 2008]</span></span><br>
e. RAVL currently under the Senate's control may not be disbanded.<br>
f. All RAVL in play are considered when determining a Faction's Total
Revolt Strength if multiple Factions attempt to revolt in the same
Revolution Phase.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.3 LEGION ALLEGIANCE</span>:
Provincial Armies/Fleets and Garrison Legions/Fleets are automatically
loyal to a Primary Rebel Governor. Veteran Legions Aligned to a Loyal
Senator currently in the Province may either be maintained by the
Governor or returned to the Senate; however, before combat any Loyal
Senator's Aligned Legions in the Rebel Army will defect to the
Senate's Army. [The Governor may wish to maintain such legions in case
the Senator to which those Legions are Aligned to dies before the
Combat Phase; since such Legions would no longer be aligned with a
Loyal Senator they would fight for the Rebel]. A Secondary Rebel
Governor may only maintain Rebel Aligned Veteran Legions (RAVL) and
Provincial Armies/Fleets in the province - he must immediately return
all other Forces to the Senate.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.4 FLEET ALLEGIANCE</span>: A
Victorious Commander attempting to revolt may dice for the loyalty of
Roman Fleets under his command as if they were Legions (2.3.3) and pay
maintenance for those that remain loyal to him. He may forfeit their
control to the Senate if he prefers not to pay for them. A rebel that
Marches on Rome on the turn that he declares his revolt does not need
Fleets but by taking control of them away from the Senate he may make
it easier to acquire reinforcements from Secondary Rebel Provinces on
future turns (i.e. Naval Interception).<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.5 MARCHING ON ROME</span>: If a
Primary Rebel Governor elects to march on Rome he may never return to
his Province (though he still collects all income from it to use as
maintenance for his Army). His strength is equal to to the sum of his
Provincial Armies and
Legions (Veterans count double as usual) plus his Military Rating. If
he has no Legions, his Provincial Armies only count half (fractions
rounded up). If he marches on Rome, he may not use his Province&#8217;s Base
Strength, which remains behind in the Province (see 2.2.53). The revolt
itself is resolved as in the standard rules (11.52) except for
Reinforcements &amp; Naval Interceptions (2.2.51). There is no Naval
Interception provided he decides to immediately march on Rome on his
initial declaration (future reinforcements from Provinces with a
printed Fleet Strength will require a Naval Interception Check) or if
his Province has a printed fleet strength of 0.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.51 REINFORCEMENTS</span>: On any
Revolution Phase following a Combat Phase where a Primary Rebel
Marching on Rome achieves a Stalemate result against the Senate's Army,
a Secondary Rebel Governor may attempt to reinforce the Primary Rebel's
army with any forces he currently has in his Province. The
reinforcements are automatically added to the Primary Rebel's army if
that Province has a printed fleet strength of 0. If the Province has a
printed fleet strength greater than 0 then the reinforcements are
considered to be "in transit". Reinforcements "in transit" are added to
the Primary Rebel's army only if it avoids Naval Interception (2.3.52)
during the next Combat Phase. Only one Secondary Rebel may reinforce
the Primary Rebel each Revolution Phase. The Senate cannot attack a
rebel province if that Province has already reinforced the Primary
Rebel or has forces "in transit".&nbsp; A Province which has reinforced
the Primary Rebel or has forces "in transit" may not build any new
Provincial Forces however the Governer continues to receive Provincial
Income which he must use to maintain the Province's Base Strength - any
excess income can be used to maintain forces "in transit" or in the
Primary Rebel's army in Italy. Forces "in transit" are always
maintained by the Province from which they are transferring from.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.52 NAVAL INTERCEPTIONS</span>:
Whenever a Rebel Governor attempts to March on Rome on a turn after he
declares his revolt or attempts to reinforce a Primary Rebel already
Marching on Rome, that Governor's forces are subject to a Naval
Interception by the Senate if the Province's Base Fleet Strength is
greater
than 0. <font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif">A
Naval Interception battle is resolved
before any other battle during the Combat Phase. </font></font><font
 color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif">The Province's
Battle Strength is equal to its Base Fleet Strength plus any Provincial
and Garrison Fleets in the Province - the Governor's Military Rating is
not added to the Fleet Strength.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font
 face="Arial Unicode MS, serif"> </font></font><font color="#000000"><font
 face="Arial Unicode MS, serif">Provincial Fleets are always counted at
full strength unlike Provincial Armies. In order to initiate a Naval
Interception, the Senate must pass a proposal to send a Fleet (without
Commander) to attack the Province's Fleet. This Roman Fleet can serve
no other purpose during that Combat Phase. Resolve the battle normally
with a TDR comparing the two Fleet's Strengths. A Roman Victory results
in the reinforcement attempt failing though that Province may attempt
to move its Forces to Italy again starting next Revolution Phase.
If&nbsp; Rome
suffers a Defeat or Stalemate (or does not send a Fleet to do battle)
then the Provincial Armies and Legions from that Province are
immediately added to the Primary Rebel's Army for use in the current
Combat Phase. Also note that Battle Losses are taken equally from each
side for every result other than "No Losses" and "ALL" <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(only fleets are subject to such combat
losses)</span>.&nbsp; Mortality
chits are not drawn for this battle and
battle results have no effect on
Unrest.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.6 REMAINING IN A REBEL PROVINCE</span>:
If a Primary Rebel Governor remains in his Province (instead of
Marching on Rome), he cannot win due to the failure of the Senate to
send an Army against him or even for defeating the Army the Senate
sends against him (1.11.052) but his Revolt still counts as one of the
four
Active Wars needed to destroy Rome and costs the State 20 Talents per
turn. He can however still win if there is a People Revolt or the State
Treasury is exhausted. His strength is equal to the Province&#8217;s Base
Strength plus </font></font>Provincial Armies/Fleets and Garrison
Legions/Fleets<font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif">
in the Province plus his Military Rating. If in a future Revolution
Phase, the Primary Rebel Governor decides to March on Rome and the
Province has a printed fleet strength greater than 0; the Senate can
attempt to prevent the rebel from landing in Italy with a successful
Naval Interception (2.3.52). If the Senate does not send an Army to
attack the Primary Rebel Governor remaining in his Province - that
Revolt is considered Unprosecuted and will increase Unrest per the
normal rules.<br>
</font></font><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.61 ATTACKING A REBEL PROVINCE</span>:
Rome can attempt to defeat a Rebel Governor by attacking his Province
directly. Rome cannot attack a Province if its Governor is Marching on
Rome (2.3.5) or if the Province has reinforced the Primary Rebel or has
forces "in transit" to the Primary Rebel.<br>
<br>
The Rebel's Army Strength is equal to the sum of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Base Army Strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provincial Armies (count half if no Legions are in
the Province)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Garrison Legions (Veterans count double as usual)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Military Rating of Rebel<br>
<br>
The Rebel's Fleet Support Strength is equal to the sum of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Base Fleet Strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provincial Fleets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roman Fleets<br>
<br>
If the number of Provincial and Roman fleets in the Province (not
including the Base Fleet Strength) exceeds
the combined Land Strength of the Province (Base + Armies + Legions), a
Naval Battle must be fought first. Provincial Armies are always counted
at full strength when determining a Naval Battle requirement.<br>
<br>
The Rebel's Naval Strength would be equal to the sum of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Base Fleet Strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provincial Fleets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roman Fleets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Military Rating of Rebel<br>
<br>
If the Province's Maximum Fleets value is 0 then the Province
automatically has a Fleet Support Strength and
Naval Battle Strength of 0 even if the Province has Rebel Roman Fleets.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.62 RESOLUTION</span>: When
attacking a Rebel Province use rule (11.52) from the original rulebook
for resolution with the following differences:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>A Defeat does not result in the
Rebel winning the game; however, if the Governor had at least one
Legion at the start of the battle, then all non-Veteran Legions that
survive the battle defect to the Province and become loyal to the
Rebel. Increase Unrest by 2 in a Defeat. In a Stalemate, if the
Governor had at least one Legion at the start of
the battle, then each non-Veteran Legion must roll a dr to see if it
defects to the Province. If the Senate's Army Commander survived the
battle a roll of "1'" will result in defection, if the Commander did
not survive a roll of "1-3" will result in defection. A Victory against
a Secondary Rebel Governor kills that Governor and
the Province card is returned undeveloped to the Forum with no
Provincial Forces but the Revolt continues since the Primary Rebel is
still alive. Rebel Legions/Fleets under that Governor's command are
returned to Rome. A Victory against a Primary Rebel Governor kills all
Rebels and
all Rebel Province cards are returned to the Forum undeveloped with no
Provincial Forces. Rebel Legions/Fleets are returned to Rome. [The
Victorious Commander may in turn Rebel if he so desires]. The
Victorious Commander gains Popularity and Influence equal to the
Strength of the War minus the Governor's Military Rating. Decrease
Unrest by 1.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.7 REBEL MORTALITY</span>: If a
Primary Rebel dies from a Mortality Chit draw then the Revolt is ended
even in the case where the Senate's Army lost a battle against him; All
Secondary Rebel Governors are killed and
all Rebel Province cards are returned to the Forum undeveloped with no
Provincial Forces; Rebel Legions/Fleets are returned to Rome. If a
Secondary Rebel Governor dies from a Mortality Chit draw his Province
is returned undeveloped to the Forum with no Provincial Forces and his
Rebel Legions/Fleets are returned to Rome. Reinforcements to the
Primary Rebel are not affected by his death but if these Reinforcements
were "in transit" then they are all lost with Legions/Fleets being
returned to Rome.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.3.8 REBEL VICTORY</span>: If the
Rebel Army attacks the Senate in Italy and achieves a victorious result
the revolt has succeeded and the rebel now rules Rome and wins the
game, barring the collapse of the Republic (1.12.4). If, however, he
defeats the Senatorial Army attacking him in his rebel province he does
not win the game. For the Rebel to win he must either attack the Senate
in Italy (i.e. March on Rome) and win a battle OR wait and hope for a
People Revolt or State Bankruptcy result.<br>
<h1>2.4 Example</h1>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Mithridates Attacks Asia</span><br>
The 1st and 2nd Mithridatic Wars have been drawn (10/5 and 6/4) but the
Senate Army rolled a Disaster while attacking the 1st Mithridatic War -
the 2nd Mithridatic War was not attacked. The 1st War is considered
Prosecuted, the 2nd War is Unprosecuted. Asia is currently a Developed
Roman Province at full strength with a Base of 6/5 and Provincial
Forces of 10/10 and has 1 Garrison Legion as well. Its Governor is
Julius (Military 4). Asia is listed as the first Province on both War
cards so Asia will have to attack both Wars starting with the 1st
Mithridatic War which is 20/5 due to a Matching War. Asia's strength is
21/15 (6/5 + 10/10 +1/0 + 4). If the Legion had not been sent to Asia,
the Province would only have had a strength of 15/15 since the
Provincial Armies would only count at half strength.<br>
<br>
The TDR modifier against the 1st Mithridatic War is +1. The Combat Roll
is 11 and the result is 12 which results in a Stalemate with the loss
of 1 Army and 1 Fleet. There is a 1 in 11 chance that the Garrison
Legion will be the one Eliminated but fortunately it was determined
(via e-mail dice roll) that a Provincial Army was lost instead. The
Garrison Legion now becomes a Veteran Legion aligned to Julius. Asia's
strength is now 21/14 (6/5 + 9/9 + 2/0 + 4) and it must attack the 2nd
Mithridatic War (12/4 due to a Matching War). 2 Mortality Chits are
drawn but Julius lives.<br>
<br>
The TDR modifier against the 2nd Mithridatic War is +9. The Combat Roll
is 7 and the result is 16 which results in a Victory with the loss of 2
Armies and 2 Fleets. Unfortunately, the Veteran Legion is deemed to be
one of the units lost (via e-mail dice roll) and since there is no
Legion remaining after Combat, Provincial Army losses are doubled, so 2
more Provincial Armies are lost. 5 Mortality Chits are drawn and Julius
lives and gains 3 Popularity and 3 Influence. Since there is a Matching
War in play the 2nd Mithridatic War is shuffled back into the deck
there being more than 6 cards left in it. Asia now has 7 Armies and 7
Fleets left.<br>
<br>
Asia will not be able to build any Forces next Revenue Phase because it
is listed as a Province on the 1st Mithridatic War card. Asia's
strength is now 14/12 (6/5 + 7/7 + 4)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Julius Rebels<br>
</span>On the next turn the Senate sends a Garrison Legion to Asia to
reinforce Julius and then sends an army to attack the 1st Mithridatic
War again. This time the Senate's Army suffers a Standoff - so Asia
does not attack the War. During the Revolution Phase, Julius declares
himself in revolt but decides not to March on Rome at this time.
Another Senator in Julius' faction, Calpurnius, declares himself as a
Secondary Rebel. Calpurnius is currently Governor of Nearer Spain which
currently has 10 Provincial Armies. All forces in Julius' Province are
loyal to him but he needs to pay for their maintenance. Since Asia is
not a Roman Province next Revenue Phase it collects all income even
though the 1st Mithridatic War is still in the Forum. Julius rolls a 4
for Personal Income and a 9 for State Income resulting in total income
of (4+6) + (9+3) + 50&nbsp; = 72. He has no money in his Personal
Treasury but this will suffice. He has a Base of 6/5, Provincial Forces
of 7/7 and a Garrison Legion for a total maintenance cost of
(11+14+1)*2 = 52 with 20 talents left over. He spends these on building
two more Provincial Armies (now 9/7). Asia's Strength is now 6/5 + 9/7
+ 1/0 + 4 = 20/12 and Julius is left with no money to spare. Calpurnius
collects just enough from his Province to maintain his entire force.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. The Senate Attacks Asia</span><br>
The Senate deems that the revolt is more important to defeat than the
Mithridatic War so sends an Army to attack the Rebel Julius in Asia.
The Senate sends an army with a total strength including Military
Ratings of 27/12 The TDR modifier is +7. The Combat Roll is 6 and the
result is 13 which results in a Stalemate with no losses. Julius' lone
Legion becomes a Veteran Legion aligned to him (will require no
maintenance). Each non-Veteran legion in the Roman Army must now check
for defection (2.3.62). Four "1"s are rolled so four regular Legions
defect to Julius' army. The Roman Commander becomes a Proconsul and
Julius' revolt becomes Prosecuted.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Julius Marches on Rome<br>
</span>During the Revolution Phase, Julius decides to March on Rome but
since Asia has a printed Fleet Strength &gt; 0, Julius' army must avoid
Naval Interception during the next Combat Phase in order to land in
Italy and attack the Senate's army. His army is now considered "in
transit" so he can build no new Forces next Revenue Phase. His Army
strength in Italy (if it avoids Interception) will be 9 Provincial
Armies + 4 Regular Legions + 1 Veteran Legion + 4 Military Rating =
19/0. His Naval Interception Strength is 5 (Base) + 7 (Fleets) = 12.
During the Revenue Phase he collects 70 talents from Asia with which he
maintains all his Armies and Fleets. Total Maintenance requirement is
(11+16+4)*3 = 62 talents. 8 Talents remain in his Personal Treasury.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Naval Interception<br>
</span>During the Senate Phase, the Senate recalls the Proconsul from
Asia&nbsp; It dispatches 12 Fleets to attempt Naval Interception of
Julius as well as an army of Strength of 24/0 to attack Julius in case
the Naval Interception fails. The Naval Interception TDR is +0 and the
roll is 11 which results in a Stalemate. Rome loses 2 Fleets and Julius
loses 2 Provincial Fleets. No Mortality Chits are drawn. Since Rome did
not achieve a Victory Julius is now in Italy.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Julius Lands in Italy</span><br>
The Senate now attacks Julius' army with a +5 TDR. The Roll is a 8 so
the result is another Stalemate with no losses. Each side gains a
Veteran Legion. Rome's Army is at 25/0 while Julius' is at 20/0. The
Revolt is considered Prosecuted.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">7. Calpurnius Reinforces Julius</span><br>
During the Revolution Phase, Calpurnius now reinforces Julius in Italy.
Since Nearer Spain has a Printed Fleet Strength of 0, Calpurnius' 10
Provincial Armies are immediately added to Julius' Army bringing up his
Strength to 30/0. Both Nearer Spain's and Asia's Income are used to
maintain Julius's Army which includes 19 Provincial Armies, 3 Regular
Legions and 2 Veteran Legions. Things are not looking good for Rome.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8. Conclusions<br>
</span> The Senate should be careful about sending a Garrison Legion to
a Province. The Senate should be especially careful about sending an
army to fight a Rebel in his Province if the Rebel has at least one
Legion; the Desertion rule can have a major effect. In this case, Rome
should probably have attacked the much weaker Province of Nearer Spain
first. Calpurnius only had a Strength of&nbsp; 8 since he had no
Legions. If the Senate had not attacked Julius in Asia then Julius'
delay in Marching on Rome would have gained him little - only 2 more
Provincial Armies were built. A successful Naval Interception would
have delayed Julius at least one more turn - if he had immediately
marched on Rome there would have been no Naval Interception.<br>
<h1>2.5 Strategy</h1>
<br>
Note that a Prinary Rebel Governor can win the game even if he is not
marching on Rome if the Senate faces a People Revolt or Bankruptcy.
Greece, Asia, and Syria can be excellent provinces for such a revolt
because they can each build 10 fleets. When maxed out on fleets each
province will have a Fleet Support Strength of 15. The senate may very
well not have the funds to build such a large navy which would mean
that the province cannot be attacked. A maxed out Asia with 1 garrison
legion and a governor with a military rating of 4 would have a strength
ot 6/5 + 10/10 + 1/0 + 4/0 = 21/15. If the senate rolls a Stalemate
then it risks legions defecting to the rebel. If the 2nd Catiline
Conspiracy has not yet been drawn and the HRAO has low popularity there
is a very good chance of a People Revolt. This event card can easily
result in the loss of 9 Popularity from the HRAO (due to drawing a Draw
Two chit). A roll of 8 or less on the Population Table would then
result in a victory for the rebel governor - if there are droughts or
unprosecuted wars then the chances are even greater. The Blackmail card
can also be used to great effect to reduce the HRAO's popularity prior
to rolling on the Population Table. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
