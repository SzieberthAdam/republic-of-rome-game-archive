<h1>RoR Optional Rules<br>
</h1>
[Much credit to these rules goes to Christopher K. Farrell who came up
with the original idea for many of them. I have made many small and
large changes here and there and added a few of my own.]
<br>
<br>
<h3>1. State Collects Calpurnian Law Fines<br>
</h3>
Fines collected from the Calpurnian Law go directly to the State
Treasury.<br>
<h3>2. Required Random Event<br>
</h3>
In the Middle and Late Republic, the HRAO should roll once on the
Random Events chart before taking his first initiative.<br>
<h3>3. Legion Popularity Loss</h3>
A commander loses popularity equal to half the number of legions lost
(fractions rounded down) in a Disaster, Standoff, or Stalemate, and
equal to a third of the legions lost (frd) in a Victory. There is no
popularity loss for losing fleets.<br>
<h3>4. Keeping Spoils of War</h3>
In the Late Republic, during the Revolution Phase a victorious
commander must make one dr for every 10T (or fraction thereof) of the
War's Spoils. He may then retain that many talents in his personal
treasury, with the remainder going to the State. If he keeps the
spoils, then for each dr rolled, the senator must lose 1 popularity and
1 influence. If the commander rebels he can keep all of the spoils. The
dice are rolled before the commander decides to rebel or not; if he
rebels then he can keep the remainder.<br>
<h3>5. Popularity Cap (X)</h3>
Any Senator who ends the Population Phase with more than X popularity
must lose 1 point of popularity. A Statesman cannot be reduced to less
than his printed popularity by this decrease. X is determined by the
players prior to starting the game.<br>
<h3>6. Gabinian Law Playability<br>
</h3>
Allow this Law to be played after the Late Period Pirate War is
discarded as well.<br>
<h3>7. Tribal Assembly</h3>
by Christopher K. Farrell<br>
<br>
Change T. Sempronius Gracchus' special advantage from "May propose one
land bill per turn" to "Influence loss for introducing a measure to the
Tribal Assembly is 1." No Senator may introduce a measure to the Tribal
Assembly until after T. Gracchus has in the Middle Republic; he is
assumed to have already done so in the Late Republic.<br>
<br>
In order to introduce a measure to the Tribal Assembly, a senator must
play a Tribune (a statesman's free tribune cannot be used) and
immediately lose 3 Influence. Any proposal may be introduced to the
Tribal Assembly that could normally be voted on in the Senate,
*including* elections for all offices *except* for Censor. Prosecutions
also cannot be proposed. The voting procedure is the same, except that
each faction receives votes for the sum of its (in-Rome) Senator's
*popularity*, plus the oratory of any *one* senator in his faction
(must be the senator who introduced the measure for the playing
faction), and that player who played the Tribune is the Presiding
Magistrate. Money can still be spent to buy votes normally, but each
vote costs *2* talents instead of the normal 1. Negative popularity
does subtract from a faction's votes; if a faction has 0 or fewer
votes, they may not vote except to play a tribune. A Tribune (including
a statesman's free tribune) may be used to veto a measure in the Tribal
Assembly; no other form of veto (PM, Statesman's free *veto*, etc...)
may be used (although GRAFT and MURDER OF A TRIBUNE may be used to
cancel the tribune's motion, in which case the influence loss for the
initiating senator is voided). One MOB VIOLENCE card should be added to
the Middle Republic deck (use a convenient card from the Late
Republic); These may now additionally be played against any faction
trying to introduce a measure to the Tribal Assembly; they must be
played before the voting commences, and if the initiating senator is
killed the measure is considered cancelled. Only one MOB VIOLENCE card
may be played per measure. Whenever a measure is introduced to the
Tribal Assembly and not cancelled before voting commences, increase the
Unrest Level by 1.<br>
<h3>8. Optional Provinces</h3>
by Christopher K. Farrell<br>
<br>
Whenever a Commander is victorious in either the Invasion of Britain or
Invasion of Germany, *and* loses at most 2 legions, he (the commander)
may opt to create the provinces of Britannia, or Upper Germany,
respectively. If a commander defeats the Invasion of Germany with no
losses, he may opt to create Upper and Lower Germany. In the senate
phase after the defeat of the Alexandrine War, the Senate may pass a
motion to create the province of Egypt. If this motion is not passed
immediately, the Egypt province may not be created; this proposal, if
made, may not be vetoed. Egypt starts and remains developed; it never
becomes undeveloped. All four provinces are border provinces. The
Governor of Egypt must be a prior consul; if no prior consul is
available, elect any senator for a one-year term (returning in the
following revenue phase). A one-year governor is subject to the full
fining/prosecution if he takes personal income. Egypt must be allocated
before a prior consul is sent to any other provinces; the last
available candidate rule is in effect.
<pre>Numbers are undeveloped - developed<br></pre>
<pre>                 Britain       Upper Germany   Lower Germany<br>Base Strength    2/1 - 3/2     2/0 - 4/0       1/0 - 3/0<br>Personal Income  dr-3 - dr+1   dr-2 - dr+2     dr-3 - dr-1<br>State Income     dr-5 - dr-1   dr-3 - dr-1     dr-5 - dr-2<br>Local Taxes      10 - 25       20 - 30         10 - 15<br>Maximum Forces   5/5 - 7/7     6/0 - 10/0      5/0 - 10/0<br>Defends Against  none          none            none</pre>
<br>
Egypt:<br>
Base Strength: 3/7<br>
Personal Income: TDR [or dr+7]<br>
State Income: TDR [or DR+4]<br>
Local Taxes: 60<br>
Maximum Forces: 7/13<br>
Defends Against: none<br>
<br>
[Editor&#8217;s Note: The author had confused the term Lower Germany with
Southern Germany. Lower Germany refers to the Lower banks of the Rhine
and therefore Northern Germany; I have made the appropriate changes
above. I don't like the fact that there are two Germanic provinces and
would have preferred there to be only one.]<br>
<h3>9. New Law Cards</h3>
by Christopher K. Farrell<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Increased
Reliance on Italian Auxiliaries</span> (Early Republic)<br>
The
player who plays this law loses dr/2 (FRD) Popularity from each of his
senators (roll once for each senator) and the unrest level is increased
by 2. Each legion may now have an "auxiliary" attached for 4 talents.
Auxiliaries increase the strength of the legion by 50%, with fractions
rounded down in the final total; Auxiliaries may not be attached to an
already veteran legion. Denote strengthened legions in any convenient
way. Such legions require a 2T bribe to increase the likelihood of
loyalty. This law can only be played during the 2nd Punic, 1st Gallic,
or either Macedonian War. All Auxiliaries go home and this law is
repealed when both the 2nd Punic and 2nd Macedonian War are defeated;
increase the unrest by an additional 2 when the law is repealed. If
this law is played, increase the Social War to 15. While this law is in
play, the effects of any "Allied Enthusiasm" events that come up are
halved (FRD).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Senate
declares a National Emergency </span>(Early Republic):<br>
The
sponsoring player loses 4 popularity off his highest popularity
senator, and all other senators in the playing faction lose 2
popularity; all other faction leaders 2 popularity and all other
senators lose 1 popularity. The Unrest Level is increased by 3. All
Landbills are immediately repealed and no more may be passed this turn,
and any Manpower Shortage/No Recruitment is eliminated. Additionally,
the first 5 units raised in the Senate Phase may be raised for half
price, and the owners of the Arms/Fleet Building concessions receive no
income from any forces built this turn, and the largest numbered
Standoff and Disaster numbers on all wars/leaders are ignored for this
turn only. May only be played if there are matching Macedonian or Punic
Wars in play, or wars with a total strength of 20 or more.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rhodian
Maritime Alliance</span> (Early Republic)<br>
Treat as if the Rhodian
Maritime Alliance event had come up.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Provincial
Command</span> (Late Republic)<br>
Allows more flexibility in the
use of provincial forces; any commander who is also a governor (by the
Vatinian Law) may add any provincial forces from a province he is
governing to his command at any time before the combat TDR if the
province is listed on the war he is attacking (not necessarily the
first province). As long as he remains a commander, the provincial
forces may remain part of his forces (even if he attacks a different
war that no longer lists the original province). When he is no longer a
commander, the provincial forces are returned to the province.
Provincial forces are always loyal to their commander, and may not be
recalled or disbanded by the Senate.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Provincial
Reorganization</span> (Late Republic)<br>
Combine each of Nearer
&amp; Further Spain, Transalpine &amp; Narbonese Gaul, Cisalpine Gaul
&amp; Sardinia- Corsica, and Syria &amp; Cilicia-Cyprus into one
province each (for a total of 4 larger provinces). Each one of these
provinces must be governed by a prior consul if one is available,
otherwise elect anyone to a one-year term. Each of the provinces has
the combined value of each of it's smaller provinces, and the combined
province should be notated by stacking the smaller provinces. Anything
that would effect one of the provinces (Pretender, Barbarians, etc.)
effects the one new province similarly. If either province is
unimproved, the new province is treated as unimproved (although are
improved/sacked together afterwards). All governors in affected
provinces are immediately recalled when this law is played. Once this
law is played, the Vatinian Law may not be played; Likewise, if the
Vatinian Law is in play, this law may not be played.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tradition Erodes
II</span> (Late Republic)<br>
All provinces that require a
prior consul, except Egypt, may now be assigned to anyone.<br>
<h3><a name="Delayed_Matching_Wars"></a>11. Delayed Matching Wars</h3>
by Avalon Hill<br>
<br>
7.3321 TIME DELAY: Whenever a War of Revolt card is drawn from the deck
that would match a face-up War or Revolt card already located in the
Forum, the drawn card is placed face-down in an Inactive War slot for
the remainder of the current turn. If the face-up card is currently
located in an Inactive War slot, it is immediately moved to an Active
War slot; otherwise, face-up cards are not affected in any way. At the
beginning of each turn, before any other action is taken, all cards in
Inactive War slots are turned face-up, and one card for each War or
Revolt is moved to an Active War slot on the Forum. Wars should be
selected for activation in chronological order (e.g. 1st Macedonian
before 2nd Macedonian) whenever possible. An Inactive War and its
leader are instantly matched and activated; there is no delay. If a
Leader is drawn that matches an Active War, the Leader is immediately
placed on the Active War card--but no additional War cards are
activated.<br>
<h3><a name="Military_Statesmen_Void_Disasters"></a>12. Military
Statesmen Void Disasters<br>
</h3>
a. All Statesman that void any war's Disaster/Standoff numbers instead
now void ALL Disaster
numbers on ALL wars and leaders in the game but do not void ANY
Standoff numbers.
Also,
add this ability to both Caesar and Pompey. So the affected Statesman
are: #1A, #18A, #19A, #1B, #1C, #27A, #4A, #30A. [Also, increase #1A
military rating to 6]. <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Note that Fabius
Maximus Cunctator is not affected by this rule - his ability remains
the same as in the original game.</span><br>
<br>
b. Statesman void associated Leader Disaster numbers as well.<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>#2A Maximus has a Faction
Loyalty of 0 when in the same faction as Marcellus.<br>
<h3><a name="Maximus_Modification"></a>12a. Maximus Modification<br>
</h3>
Change #2A Fabius Maximus Cunctator's Special Ability from:<br>
<br>
Halves all losses in combat<br>
<br>
to<br>
<br>
Halves all losses in combat on an odd TDR and ALL Disaster rolls are
converted to Standoffs.<br>
<h3>13. Defeats </h3>
Defeats take precedence over Disasters and Standoff. This really should
not be an optional rule - seems to be an oversight in the original
rules.<br>
<h3>14. Initial Intrigue Card Trading<br>
</h3>
&nbsp;Players can play any red cards that are traded during the Initial
Intrigue phase, instead of having to wait for the first Revolution
Phase.<br>
<h3>15. Temporary Rome Consul<br>
</h3>
a. No Temporary Rome Consul. The HRAO is determined normally using
Influence and Oratory, etc... read the rules!<br>
<br>
b. Randomly select an initial Family Card to be assigned Temporary Rome
Consul. Note that a Statesman played without a Family Card during
Initial Intrigue may not be assigned Temporary Rome Consul.<br>
<h3>16. Punic Wars Options<br>
</h3>
a. 1st Punic War naval strength is never doubled (or tripled,...).<br>
b. Leaders do not add to 1st Punic War naval strength or D/S numbers.<br>
c. Shuffle 1st Punic War into deck<br>
d. Hamilcar only increases the strength and adds D/S numbers to the 1st
Punic War. Hannibal only increases the strength and adds D/S numbers to
the 2nd Punic War. Both leaders still match all Punic Wars. They
activate and remain in the Forum with any Punic war.<br>
e. Rename Senator #12 Acilius to Atilius and add a new Statesman to the
Early
Republic deck: #12A M. Atilius Regulus (Mil:4,Ora:3,Loy:8,Inf:5) Voids
1st Punic War Naval Battle Disaster/Standoff. Optionally, deal this
senator out with the initial red cards to ensure that he begins the
game in a player's hand.<br>
<h3>17. Spanish Wars Options<br>
</h3>
a. Sertorian Revolt, Spanish Revolts, Numantine War, and Viriathus all
match. Since these wars are not numbered they can be attacked by the
Senate in any order. Their strength is doubled or tripled accordingly.
Viriathus is killed when all three wars are defeated.<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> There is some errata that states that
they all do match.</span><br>
b. If Nearer Spain is not a province, the Sertorian Revolt, Spanish
Revolts and Numantine War subtract half of their base land strength
from the strength of the 2nd Punic War (if these wars are inactive). <span
 style="font-style: italic;">This represents revolts against
Carthaginian rule draining forces away from the Punic effort in Italy.</span><br>
c. Viriathus matches Sertorian Revolt, Spanish Revolts, and Numantine
War; however, the wars themselves do not match and hence their strength
is never doubled or tripled. Viriathus is killed when all three wars
are defeated. <span style="font-style: italic;">Because the Middle
Republic deck is so large and this leader only matches one war, it's
likely seldom the case that Viriathus will ever come into play.</span>
<h3><a name="Starting_Provincial_Forces"></a>18. Starting Provincial
Forces</h3>
Allow provinces that start the game in play to begin with some
provincial forces already built:<br>
<br>
<pre>                     Middle Republic        Late Republic<br>Sicily               4 Armies &amp; 2 Fleets    10 Armies &amp; 5 Fleets<br>Sardinia-Corsica     1 Fleet                1 Army &amp; 4 Fleets<br>Cisalpine Gaul       1 Army                 8 Armies<br>Illyricum                                   6 Armies<br>Further Spain                               6 Armies<br>Nearer Spain                                5 Armies<br>Greece                                      3 Armies &amp; 3 Fleets<br>Africa                                      2 Armies &amp; 2 Fleets<br>Asia                                        2 Armies &amp; 2 Fleets<br>Narbonese Gaul<br>Cilicia-Cyprus</pre>
<h3>19. Late Republic Variable Ending Rule</h3>
The following rule can be used to help prevent the "end of the world"
syndrome which occurs when artifical time limits dictate the end of the
scenario and send all players off on a desperate grab for influence or
assassination attempts. [Rule was originally mentioned by AH in a
slightly different form than that presented here.]<br>
<br>
At the end of every turn, starting with the turn the second deck
expires, a die is rolled to see if the game ends. The game ends on a
die roll of 6 or more. There is a +2 modifier for every turn that the
die is rolled without resulting in the end of the game (a maximum of 3
new turns may be added in this fashion).<br>
<br>
When a player is required to draw a new card from the deck but there
are none, he instead draws from a new deck of 24 cards consisting of
the following:<br>
<br>
2 Senators : #26 Octavius, #27 Marius<br>
3 Statesman: #28A Cicero, #29B Lucullus, #30A Pompeius<br>
2 Laws : Julian Law, Plautian-Papirian Law<br>
7 Intrigue : Proscription, Murder of a Tribune, Influence Peddling,
Assassin, Secret Bodyguard, Tribune, Tribune<br>
6 Wars : Social War, 1st Mithridatic War, 2nd Mithridatic War 3rd
Mithridatic War, Sertorian Revolt, Gladiator Slave Revolt<br>
2 Leaders : Mithridates VI, Spartacus<br>
2 Events : Ptolemy Apion Bequest, Bithynian Bequest<br>
<br>
As soon as this draw is made, the game is considered to be in the Late
Republic for purposes of Legion Allegiance and Random Events rolls.<br>
<br>
[I wanted the maximum number of new turns to be three so I decided to
include only 24 cards in this new deck. I looked at all the ratios of
card types to deck size and also the historical chronology to determine
which cards to include. These cards go right up to the time that Julius
Caesar would have made an impact and historically makes for a nice
clean cutting off period. The biggest choices to make were the Senators
and Statesman since these would most likely have the biggest effect on
the deck. Pompeius was added not only for historical accuracy, since he
prosecuted the 3rd Mithridatic and Slave Revolt, but also because his
miltary rating (on average) is good. Lucullus (and Marius to a degree)
were added to counter the potentially dangerous matching Mithridatic
wars. Cicero was a tough choice but I wanted 5 Senators/Statesman and
he historically appeared slightly before the others I think. Octavius
was added to fill out. Something similar should be done for the Late
Republic, however there are no cards to fill out this period at the
moment.]<br>
<h3>20. Voluntary Retirement</h3>
During the Early and Middle republic (of an extended game only) a
player can voluntarily retire any Senator with influence greater than
20 that he has in play in Rome during any Population Phase (after the
Population Roll) or Revolution Phase. The Senator must lose all
counters, except for Faction Leader and Talents, and he must return all
attached cards to the Forum. The player keeps any family card. The
current influence of the Senator is recorded and is added to that
player's final influence tally for determining victory conditions. A
retired Statesman is discarded from play. If the player does not
control the family card then all counters (including faction leader)
and cards are removed or moved to the Forum.<br>
<h3>21. Elder Statesman</h3>
During the mortality phase, a Statesman without an Age marker receives
one numbered "1". A Statesman with an Age marker has its number
increased by 1. If the number on the marker is greater than or equal to
7 that Statesman is considered to be an Elder Statesman. A roll must be
made for each Elder Statesman during the Mortality Phase to see if that
Statesman dies. A dr of 6 results in the death of that Statesman. For
each number greater than 7 on the marker, 1 is added to the dr roll. An
Elder Statesman cannot leave Rome (for example, to fight a War or
Govern a province) or attempt an assassination. This does not prevent
him from becoming a Dictator or Field Consul, it merely prevents him
from being sent to fight a War (or anything else that could make him
leave Rome). He is not forced to return to Rome if he is already away.
An Elder Statesman can go into Exile normally.<br>
<h3>22. The Ligurian Wars</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1st/2nd/3rd Ligurian Wars 197-154 BC</span><br>
6/0; Inactive until attacked; -20 per Turn if Active; D4/S17;<br>
10t Spoils; [Attacks: Cisalpine Gaul, Narbonese Gaul]<br>
<br>
Do not shuffle these cards into the deck. The 1st Ligurian War is
placed in the Forum when the 1st Gallic War is defeated.
When the 1st Ligurian War is defeated, the war is discarded and the 2nd
Ligurian War is placed in the Forum. Likewise, when the 2nd Ligurian
War is defeated the 3rd Ligurian War
is placed in the Forum. All three wars are discarded (with no spoils)
if
they have not been already when the game enters the Late Republic.
These wars never go into the deck for any reason, they are discarded
instead. If playing the Middle Republic Scenario, place the 1st
Ligurian War in the forum at the start of the game.<br>

[Historically when things were quiet on the war front, consuls would go
off "triumph-hunting" by bullying up on the Ligurians. Some twelve
triumphs were awarded in these quests for booty. The Ligurians lived
roughly between Cisalpine Gaul and the Tyrrhenian Sea. This rule is
mainly to liven up the Middle Republic if it needs livening up.]<br>
<h3>23. 4-Player Game (Early Republic or Extended)</h3>
Each player is dealt 4 senators, 2 senators begin in the Forum, and 2
senators begin in the Curia. Each player is dealt 4 red cards. The
remaining red cards are shuffled into the deck. Each player can hold a
maximum of 7 red cards during the revolution phase. Initiatives 5 and 6
are dealt with in either of these manners:<br>
1. The 5th initiative is bid on normally, but bidding for the 6th
initiative begins with the player to the left of the HRAO.<br>
2. Initiative rolls are made for both initiatives and cards drawn if
necessary but players do not participate in these two initiatives (no
persuasion attempts, knights, faction leaders, games). Any red cards
drawn are randomly distributed to players except that a player cannot
receive a card if another player has received fewer cards in this
fashion throughout the entire game.<br>
Example: On turn 1, two red cards are drawn during the 5th and 6th
initiatives. If player 2 is assigned the first card then only players
1, 3, and 4 are eligible to receive the second card. If player 3
receives the second card then only players 1 and 4 are eligible for the
next red card drawn during the 5th and 6th initiatives. Only after
players 1 and 4 have received cards during the last two initiatives of
any turn, can players 1 and 2 receive cards in this fashion again.<br>
<h3><a name="Non-Privileged_Assassinations"></a>24. Non-Privileged
Assassinations</h3>
The following assassination attempts are considered "privileged":<br>
1. attempt vs a CFL nominee.<br>
2. attempt in which at least 1 Assassin card is played.<br>
3. attempt vs a Sponsor/Cosponsor of a Land Bill where both are from
the same faction.<br>
This rule makes no changes to "privileged" attempts. All other attempts
are considered "non-privileged" (NP). When a NP attempt is made roll
another dr (unmodified by any cards); if the roll is odd, 1 is
subtracted from the assassination roll; if the roll is even there is no
effect<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">These make the Middle Republic a
little more dangerous. Historically, the Syrian War occurs at the tail

</span>
<h3><a name="Revised_Refuge"></a>27. Revised Refuge</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;">It would appear that the Refuge
Random Event (which only occurs during the Early Republic) was
misworded. Since a Leader is only killed in Defeat when all wars that
it matches is defeated, leaders such as Hamilcar, Hannibal, and Philip
would not be able to use Refuge until all Punic or Macedonian Wars were
defeated - something that occurs relatively late since the last of
these wars don't appear until the Middle Republic. Antiochus would in
all likelihood be the only Leader ever to take advantage of Refuge
since he has only one matching war. Historically, Hannibal took refuge
with Eastern armies after Defeat of the 2nd Punic War. This change adds
more variability to the Leader that takes Refuge - adding more
variability to the game in general.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refuge</span><br>
The first Leader that is due to be moved to the Curia after the Defeat
of a war takes Refuge and is placed with the Refuge Event card instead.
If two leaders are due to move to the Curia simultaneously (as is the
case when both Hannibal and Hamilcar are active) then the Leader with
the highest combat modifier takes Refuge. The Leader in Refuge allies
itself with the first active War card drawn; however, if one of that
Leader's original matching wars is drawn later then the Leader is moved
from the Refuge war to that newly drawn war.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">This Event remains in play until used.</span><br>
<br>
For example, if the Refuge event is in play and both 1st and 2nd Punic
Wars are defeated while both Leaders are in play then Hamilcar goes to
the Curia but Hannibal goes to the Refuge card (where he will avoid
Curia rolls). If the 3rd Macedonian War (Active War) is drawn next then
Hannibal becomes allied to it and increases its Strength and adds to it
D/S numbers; if however, the 3rd Punic War is later drawn, Hannibal
will move from the 3rd Macedonian to the 3rd Punic.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">The primary purpose of these added
cards is
to dilute the deck a bit to make the Early Republic a little easier to
handle. The scenario should last about one more turn and the nasty wars
should on average be spaced out a little more. The Capuan Revolt is the
only new negative card as the Spanish war is ignored until the 2nd
Punic War is defeated anyway.<br>

<h3><a name="Licinian-Pompeian_Law"></a>29. Licinian-Pompeian Law</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
This is nearly identical to Christopher K. Farrell's </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Provincial Command</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> law. </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Licinian-Pompeian Law : 55 BC</span><br>
Playable only if the Vatinian Law is already in play. Allows more
flexibility in the use of provincial forces; any commander who is also
a governor (by the Vatinian Law) may add any provincial forces from a
province he is governing to his command at any time before the combat
TDR if the province is listed on the war he is attacking (not
necessarily the first province). As long as he remains a commander, the
provincial forces may remain part of his forces (even if he attacks a
different war that no longer lists the original province) - these
forces still count towards the province's maximum force. When he is no
longer a commander, the provincial forces are returned to the province.
Provincial forces are always loyal to their commander, and may not be
recalled or disbanded by the Senate.<br>
<br>
This law can also be used for the "Invasion" war cards using the
following provinces:<br>
Invasion of Britain: Transalpine Gaul<br>
Invasion of Germany: Transalpine Gaul<br>
Invasion of Parthia: Syria<br>
Invasion of Arabia: Egypt<br>
<br>
When this
optional law card is played with, A Governor may instruct any of his
Legates to join in his revolt if he is the Primary Rebel. The Senate
may not not take potential provincial armies into account when
determining the minimum force required to send with a commander to war.<br>

<h3><a name="Revised_Pontifex_Maximus"></a>30. Revised Pontifex Maximus</h3>
The Pontifex Maximux is not prevented from holding another office. A
senator currently holding an office may be elected Pontifex Maximus.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">This is historical - Caesar was
Pontifex Maximus for 20 years while he was out fighting in Gaul,
Greece, Spain, Egypt...</span><br>
<h3><a name="Revised_2nd_Catiline_Conspiracy"></a>31. Revised 2nd
Catiline Conspiracy</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;">This rule is found at </span><a
 style="font-style: italic;" href="../../../www.boardgamers.org/default.htm">http://www.boardgamers.org/</a><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> and was used at the WBC. I can only
understand part of the reasoning behind it.</span><br>
<br>
Add the following to the text of the original card:<br>
<br>
The HRAO may voluntarily step down after the effects of the 2nd
Catiline Conspiracy card have been resolved. If this Senator refuses to
step down, he is subject to immediate potential assassination, offered
first to the faction on the HRAO's left and proceeding clockwise. The
HRAO may only be subject to one assassination attempt during this
special phase. This assassination attempt does not count as a Senate
Phase assassination; thus, either the assassinating or assassinated
faction can attempt or receive further knifings in the Senate Phase.<br>
<h3><a name="Sulla_Coexistance"></a>32. Sulla Coexistance<br>
</h3>
#1C Sulla may coexist with Scipio #1A and #1B. Sulla has a Faction
Loyalty of 0 when in the same faction as either Scipio. The Scipios
both have a Faction Loyalty of 0 when in the same faction as Sulla.
Scipio #1A and Scipio #1B may not coexist.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">During the first Civil War, L.
Cornelius Sulla was on the side opposing L. Cornelius Cinna so there is
precedent for having opposing Cornelii.<br>

<h3><a name="Alternate_Reality_Variant"></a>33. Alternate Reality
Variant<br>
</h3>
A variant of the Alternate History Scenario (12.7) from the original
rulebook.<br>
<br>
1. Shuffle all 30 Senator cards together and deal 3 to each player.
Divide as evenly as possible the undealt Senators into three decks
numbered 1, 2, 3 with excess cards going into the higher numbered decks
(divided as evenly as possible).<br>
2. Shuffle all 86 Red cards (Statesman/Concession/Intrigue/Law)
together and deal 3 to each player. Divide as evenly as possible the
undealt Red cards into decks 1, 2, 3 with excess cards going into the
higher numbered decks (divided as evenly as possible).<br>
3. Shuffle all 31 War cards together and place 10 Wars in decks 1 and 2
and 11 Wars in deck 3.<br>
4. Shuffle the 8 Leader and 4 Event cards together and place 4 in each
deck.<br>
5. Shuffle all three decks. Deck 1 will be the Early Republic deck,
etc...<br>
6. Use all other rules for the Early Republic Extended Game.<br>
<br>
It's probably a good idea to play with the Military Statesman optional
rule #12 as well as Spanish Wars option #17c.<br>
<br>
If Spain is not yet a province, the Spanish Wars are inactive; however,
they may become activated in other ways (by being attacked by Rome, by
Rise from Refuge, etc...). Perhaps the Social War should activate all
Inactive wars as well - not just those with matching wars.<br>
<br>
It might also be a good idea to evenly divide the Statesman into four
piles. The first pile is included in the initial deal, the other three
are added to each deck.<br>
<br>
Perhaps modify Curia rolls for Leaders to requiring a 6 instead of a 5
or 6 in order for the Leader to die. With the shuffle you might end up
with Hannibal in deck 1 and all three Punic Wars in deck 3. This would
give the Leader a better chance of being in play when his war is drawn.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Vatinian_Law_Changes"></a>34. Vatinian Law Changes<br>
</h3>
1. Once this law is played, a province will always generate State
Income even if it has no Governor (except for provinces that were just
created in the previous turn).<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Vatinian_Law_Changes"></a>35. Censor / Governorships Order
Switch</h3>
1. Switch the order in which Governors and Censor are elected. All
province vacancies are filled first, then a Censor is elected and
prosecutions held. This allows a Governor to be recalled (by electing a
new governor) and prosecuted in the same turn.<br>
