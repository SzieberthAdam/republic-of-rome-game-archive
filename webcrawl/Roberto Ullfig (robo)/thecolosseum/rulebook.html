  <h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
  </font>REPUBLIC OF ROME is a compressed abstraction of more than 250
years of history simulating politics in the Roman Senate during the
Republic. Players control factions composed of the leading Senatorial
families and compete for state offices, military commands, economic
concessions and new adherents. Eash player attempts to increase the
strength of his faction to the point where it dominates the government.
However, the Senate must also attend to the affairs of the state in a
hostile world, necessitating a certain amount of cooperation in the
prosecution of wars and the maintenance of public contentment. Failure
to do so, especially at the outset when Rome is most vulnerable, may
result in the collapse of the Republic. Therefore the players must
defeat not only one another, but the game itself which constitutes an
ever-present opponent scheming to defeat them all. Players are advised
to keep the threat of the downfall of the Republic evermost in mind and
stand ready to cooperate for the good of the state. Otherwise, the most
likely winner will be the game, and all players will be put to the
sword!<font color="#ee0000"><br>
  </font></p>
  <p> <font color="#ee0000">
  <h3>2. GAME COMPONENTS</h3>
  </font>The game consists of the following equipment:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">one 16" x 22" gamevboard<br>
three decks of 64 cards each<br>
three six-sided dice (one colored, two white)<br>
three sheets of die-cut playing pieces<br>
six Sequence of Play/Faction Treasury cards<br>
one 24-page rulebook</p>
  <p>The number of dice to be rolled in any given table is illustrated
at the top of that table by a depiction of a die showing the number to
be rolled.<br>
  <font color="#ee0000"> </font></p>
  <p><font color="#ee0000"> </font></p>
  <p><font color="#ee0000">
  <h3>3. SEQUENCE OF PLAY</h3>
  </font></p>
  <p>Each Game Turn represents one year within a compressed, abstract
framework wherein lackluster "years" are skipped to keep the action
constant. Each turn is composed of seven Phases. </p>
  <p><strong>I.</strong> <a href="#MORTALITY">MORTALITY PHASE (5):</a>
The Banker randomly draws one Mortality Chit to determine any deaths
by natural causes. </p>
  <p><strong>II.</strong> <a href="#REVENUE">REVENUE PHASE (6):</a>
The Banker adjusts the Revenue markers on the State Treasury Track. </p>
  <p>1. Each player collects Personal Revenues from the "Bank" due his
individual Senators (including Personal Income of Governors) and
places the appropriate gold money markers on their Senator cards.
Each Governor of an undeveloped Province then makes a dr attempting to
improve that Province. Any rebel Senators then pay maintenance for
their forces. </p>
  <p>2. The Banker collects state revenues and pays for current Wars,
Land Bills, and maintenance of loyal forces out of the State Treasury,
recording the new totals and advising all players of the state's
finances. Personal Contributions are solicited and simultaneously
accepted. Advance the Term markers of loyal Governors and move
Province cards of returning Governors to the Forum. </p>
  <p>3. Each player redistributes wealth among the loyal Senators of
his Faction and/or his Faction Treasury. <a name="3.III"></a></p>
  <p><a name="3.III"><strong>III.</strong></a> <a href="#FORUM">FORUM
PHASE (7):</a> Remove all expired Event cards from the previous turn.
Each player, starting with the <em>HRAO</em>, in clockwise succession
takes his <em>Initiative</em>. Each Initiative consists of the
following actions: </p>
  <p>1. Make a DR. If the DR is a "7", roll a TDR on the Random Events
Table and place the corresponding Even card in the Forum. Otherwise,
draw a card from the Forum deck. </p>
  <p>2. Make one Persuasion Attempt. </p>
  <p>3. Attempt to attract a Knight or pressure Knights. </p>
  <p>4. Change Faction Leader if desired, or sponsor Games. </p>
  <p>In games with less than six players, after all players have
finished their Initiative, the player controlling the HRAO declares
his sole bid for the right to take the next Initiative. The other
players likewise declare their sole bids in clockwise order. The
first claimant to a particular bid wins ties. The winning bid must be
paid out of a single Senator's Personal Treasury. That player then
takes his Initiative. This process is repeated if necessary until six
Initiatives have been taken during that turn. The Forum Phase
then ends and all players adjust their vote markers. </p>
  <p>The HRAO then rolls a die for each Concession/Senator in the Curia
(even if destroyed/killed that turn). If he rolls a "5" or "6", that
card is revived and placed face up in the Forum. He also rolls for
each Leader in the Curia currently without a matching War card in the
Forum and discards it on a die roll of "5" or "6". </p>
  <p><strong>IV.</strong> <a href="#POPULATION">POPULATION PHASE
(8):</a> The Unrest Level is increased by one for each Drought,
Pirate, or Unprosecuted War (<a href="#10.72">10.72</a>) currently in
effect. The HRAO then makes a Population Table TDR. </p>
  <p><strong>V.</strong> <a href="#SENATE">SENATE PHASE (9):</a> HRAO
summons Senate. </p>
  <p>1. Elect two Consuls (and a Pontifex Maximus in the Advanced
Game); new Rome Consul becomes Presiding Magistrate. </p>
  <p>2. Elect Censor from among prior Consuls; conduct any
Prosecutions. </p>
  <p>3. Elect vacant Governorships. </p>
  <p>4. Conduct all other business, adjourn Senate, and retabulate vote
markers. </p>
  <p><strong>VI.</strong> <a href="#COMBAT">COMBAT PHASE (10):</a>
Resolve all battles. </p>
  <p><strong>VII.</strong> <a href="#REVOLUTION">REVOLUTION PHASE
(11):</a> </p>
  <p>1. Starting with the HRAO and proceeding clockwise around the
table, players play, trade, or discard Intrigue cards. Any held
Statesman or Concession to be activated during the coming turn, must
be played now. </p>
  <p>2. Each Governor and each victorious Commander announces (HRAO
first and then clockwise around the table) whether he will return his
command to the Senate or revolt. <font color="#ee0000">
  <h3>4. PREPARE TO PLAY: (EARLY REPUBLIC
SCENARIO)</h3>
  </font></p>
  <p><strong>4.1</strong> GAMEBOARD: Place the gameboard so that each
player has ample space offboard to display the cards that will
constitute his Faction. Give each player a Faction Treasury/Sequence
of Play card. </p>
  <p><strong>4.2</strong> MARKERS: Place the 36 Mortality chits in an
opaque cup suitable for a random draw. Place a Revenue marker on the
"100" box of the State Treasury Track and the Unrest Level Marker on
the "0" box of the Unrest Level Track next to the Population Table.
Put four Legions in the "Active Box" and all remaining game pieces off
to the side for later use. </p>
  <p><strong>4.3</strong> BANKER: Elect one player to serve as an
unrecompensed "Banker" throughout the game. He doles out money from
game supplies as it is earned, makes change upon request, and
maintains the proper currency levels on the State Treasury Track while
keeping the State, Game, and his Faction's funds distinctly separate. </p>
  <p><strong>4.4</strong> CARDS: Separate the cards into three decks
according to the color of the illustration half of the card (white,
gray, or pink). The decks can also be distinguished by the dividing
line separating the card's illustration half from its descriptive
half: white = double line, gray = dashed, and pink = solid. Keep the
15 all-gray/all-pink Province cards and the 18 all-gray/all-pink Event
cards separate and off to the side for ready access. Separate the 20
white Senator cards and randomly deal three to each player. Return
the remaining white Senator cards to the white deck and shuffle it.
Place the 1st Punic War card in the Inactive Wars section of the
Forum. Put the gray and pink decks aside. If playing the Extended
Game Victory Conditions (12.6), the gray deck, followed by the pink
deck, will replace the depleted white deck. </p>
  <p><strong>4.5</strong> FACTION LEADERS: Each player places a
Faction Leader marker containing the symbol of his Faction on one of
his three Senators. </p>
  <p><strong>4.6</strong> TEMPORARY ROME CONSUL: The Senator in play
with the lowest ID# is Temporary Rome Consul until new Consuls can be
elected during the first Senate Phase. Place the Rome Consul and
Prior Consul markers on his card and add five to his Influence by
placing the appropriate white number chit(s) over the printed
Influence rating on his card. <a name="4.7"></a></p>
  <p><a name="4.7"><strong>4.7</strong></a> INITIAL INTRIGUE PHASE:
Each
player, starting with the temporary Rome Consul and then proceeding
clockwise around the table, draws cards from the top of the white deck
until he has drawn three red cards. He keeps the identity of his red
cards to himself, but must openly discard all black cards he drew face
up one at a time as he draws them. After each player has obtained
three red cards with which to start the game, the remaining cards plus
all black discards are reshuffled. Each player may decide to play any
Statesmen or Concessions he has now or hold them in his hand until a
subsequent Revolution Phase. There should be only one card in the
Forum: the First Punic War. </p>
  <p><strong>4.8</strong> RESOLVING TIES: Ties of any nature not
resolved by stated secondary considerations are always broken in favor
of the highest roller in a random DR. <a name="MORTALITY"><font
 color="#ee0000">
  <h3>5. MORTALITY
PHASE</h3>
  </font></a><a name="5.1"></a></p>
  <p><a name="5.1"><strong>5.1</strong></a> RESOLUTION: One Mortality
Chit is drawn at random from the cup. The Senator whose numerical ID
matches that of the chit has died of natural causes. If the named
Senator is not active, there is no effect. If a "Draw 2" marker is
drawn, it is immediately returned to the cup and two more markers are
drawn. It is possible (although very unlikely) that a "Draw 2" marker
could be redrawn several times in the same turn resulting in three or
more deaths in a single year. <a name="5.11"></a></p>
  <p><a name="5.11"><strong>5.11</strong></a> GRACCHI BROTHERS/LICINII:
No Senators with the same numerical ID can be in play at the same time
except for the Gracchi brothers (Statesmen 25A and 25B) and the
Licinii (Statesmen 29A and 29B) in the later scenarios. Should the
"25" or "29" death chit be drawn when both its respective Statesmen
are in play, the Senator affected is determined by a random DR. <a
 name="5.2"></a></p>
  <p><a name="5.2"><strong>5.2</strong></a> DEATH CONSEQUENCES:
Regardless of the cause of death, all markers (except the Faction
Leader marker) are removed from the afflicted Senator's card. unless
the deceased was a Faction Leader or Statesman, his card is returned
face down to the bottom of the Curia in the "Repopulating Rome" space,
representing a rising family member of the deceased. A dead Faction
Leader Family card always remains with his Faction unless he was
killed as a caught Assassin (<a href="#9.84">9.84</a>) or in the
resulting prosecution. A Statesman is permanently removed from play
when he dies. </p>
  <p><strong>8.3</strong> FACTION ELIMINATION: Factions are not
eliminated unless they have lost their last Senator as a result of
trying an Assassination (<a href="#9.84">9.84</a>). If a Faction has
no Senators left, that player may draw the top Senator card in the
Curia to use as his new Faction Leader. If there is none, he may sort
through the deck until he finds one. The deck is then reshuffled. <a
 name="REVENUE"><font color="#ee0000">
  <h3>6. REVENUE
PHASE</h3>
  </font></a></p>
  <p><strong>6.1</strong> PERSONAL REVENUE: Each Faction Leader
collects three Talents and all other loyal <em>Aligned</em> Senators
collect one apiece. This money, plus funds collected from
Concessions, Governorships, or Knights, is dispensed by the Banker to
each player. Although the money dispensed technically belongs to each
Senator who earned it, game consequences are such that it makes no
difference to which Senator(s) of a Faction the money is given at this
point so the money need not be given out in the exact amounts earned
by each Senator, but can be given as a lump sum to one. Personal
Treasuries are open to inspection by other players. </p>
  <p><strong>6.11</strong> KNIGHTS/CONCESSIONS: Each Senator collects
from the Bank one Talent for each Knight on his card plus the revenue
generated by any Concession he controls. </p>
  <p><strong>6.12</strong> GOVERNORSHIP: Each Governor has the option
to
roll a die or dice (as indicated on his Province card after "Personal
Income") to generate that number of Talents of Personal Revenue (above
and beyond taxes paid the State) for his Province that turn. A
Governor need not pay a negative Personal Income result, but the State
must pay for negative amounts collected by both Personal and State
Income rolls. A Governor need not collect Personal Revenue produced
by his Province, but must make that decision before rolling to
determine the amount. If he does collect Personal Income, flip the
Term marker on his Province card as a reminder of his corrupt
activities. A Governor who tries to collect Personal Revenue from his
Province (regardless of result) is considered "corrupt" and subject to
possible Prosecution or fines from the Calpurnian Law during the
Senate Phase upon his return to Rome. A Province in revolt (14.52)
produces no state tax revenue, but is plundered by the rebel Governor
who uses that revenue for his own purposes. </p>
  <p><font size="-1">EXAMPLE: The Governor of undeveloped Further Spain
rolls a "4" for State Income resulting in a loss to Rome of five
Talents (-4 -1 =-5). His Personal Income dr of "2" results in net
income of -1 (2 -3 =-1) but he need not pay any negative totals out of
his own funds. Total bill to the State Treasury is six
Talents.</font> <a name="6.13"></a></p>
  <p><a name="6.13"><strong>6.13</strong></a> REBEL MAINTENANCE: Any
Senator in revolt must pay two Talents for every Legion/Fleet in his
force (other than those Veterans owing him personal allegiance) or
return the excess forces to the State Active boxes. <a name="6.14"></a></p>
  <p><a name="6.14"><strong>6.14</strong></a> PROVINCE IMPROVEMENT:
After collecting or declining to collect his Provincial Personal
Income, the Governor of each undeveloped (gray) Province must make a
dr to see if that Province has been "improved" by Roman control. If
the dr is <font face="symbol">&sup3;</font> 6, the Province card is
flipped to its developed (pink) side. The new values listed thereon
remain in effect for the rest of the game unless that Province is
Overrun by a Barbarian Raid (<a href="#7.352">7.352</a>) or allies
with a War card (see 14.411) and is subsequently conquered again by
Rome in which case it returns to its undeveloped side. There is a +1
drm to the Improvement dr if the Governor did not attempt to gain
Personal income from the Province that turn. A developed Province
generates more income and is less susceptible to Revolt. The current
Governor of a Province when it is developed earns three Influence. </p>
  <p><strong>6.141</strong> BITHYNIA-PONTUS: The Province of Bithynia
is an exception to the normal rules for Province improvement.
Bithynia can also be improved to the new Province of Bithynia-Pontus
by a Victory in the 3rd Mithridatic War. If that War is won before
Bithynia is created, the undeveloped Province of Bithynia never
occurs. </p>
  <p><strong>6.2</strong> STATE REVENUES: The Banker records all funds
due the State and adjusts the "Revenue" markers on the State Treasury
Track. The State receives 100 Talents Annual Revenue at the start of
each Revenue Phase. </p>
  <p><strong>6.21</strong> TAXES: If there are any active Provinces,
each Governor rolls a die or dice (as indicated on that Province card
after "State income") to determine the number of Talents in taxes paid
to the State by his Province. In some cases, this can be a negative
amount and results in the Treasury Track markers being reduced
accordingly. The amount of taxes collected is recorded on the
Treasury Track by the Banker. A Province in revolt or engaged in a
Provincial War (14.4) produces no taxes for the State. </p>
  <p><strong>6.22</strong> DEBITS &amp; CONTRIBUTIONS: After adding the
Annual Revenue and Provincial Taxes to the State Treasury, subtract 20
Talents for each active War/Revolt (even if Unprosecuted) and the
appropriate amount for any Land Bills in effect. Deduct two Talents
for maintenance of each existing Legion or Fleet not in rebellion.
The Banker should advise all players whenever the State Treasury falls
below 50 or 20 Talents of the danger of Bankruptcy (and immediate
loss) to subsequent Natural Disaster/Evil Omens Event draws.
Contributions may be made simultaneously as part of a conditional gift
based on similar Contributions by other players. Any Senator (even
those not in Rome) may contribute money to the State Treasury
regardless of the level of the Treasury. In doing so, a Senator may
gain one Influence for ten Talents, three Influence for 25 Talents, or
seven Influence for 50 Talents. Excess Contributions do not
accumulate credit for Influence gains in later turns. If unable to
pay its obligations, the state is bankrupt and any declared rebel wins
the game (<a href="#12.32">12.32</a>); otherwise, all players lose. </p>
  <p><strong>6.3</strong> REDISTRIBUTION: Players may now give money
from their Faction Treasury and the Personal Treasuries of their own
Senators to any other Faction Treasury or loyal Senator-including
those of other players. Such exchange between players may be in
payment for "services rendered" in any private or public agreement
between the players (<a href="#7.37">7.37</a>). The Redistribution
Segment is the only time that currency can freely exchange hands in
this manner. Even if a trade or purchase of an Intrigue card is
arranged, and possession of the card changes hands, any payment of
Talents must wait until this phase. </p>
  <p><strong>6.31</strong> FACTION TREASURY: Money allocated to the
Faction Treasury is placed on the Sequence of Play/Faction Treasury
card in front of each player. This is the only money that may be used
to intervene in another Faction's Persuasion attempt. Money from the
Faction Treasury may also be used to maintain Legions in the event of
a revolt by a Senator of that Faction. Only money in the Faction
Treasury is safe from loss due to death. </p>
  <p><strong>6.32</strong> NON-DISCLOSURE: The contents of Faction
Treasuries are secret. Although others may view the pile of
currency there, they are not entitled to an actual count of it. <a
 name="FORUM"><font color="#ee0000">
  <h3>7. FORUM
PHASE</h3>
  </font></a></p>
  <p><strong>7.1</strong> PASSAGE OF TIME: Previous Event cards
(except uncollected Bequests, unused Refugee, and an inactive
Pretender) in the Forum are removed. <a name="7.2"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.2"><strong>7.2</strong></a> INITIATIVE: The HRAO player
must take a Initiative DR. If he rolls a "7", he must make a TDR on
the Random Events Table to determine which Event card he has drawn (<a
 href="#7.35">7.35</a>). Otherwise, he draws a card from the Forum
deck. He may then make one Persuasion Attempt and one attempt to
attract (or pressure; <a href="#7.61">7.61</a>) a Knight. Then, he
may either, appoint a different Senator of his Faction as his Faction
Leader if he wishes or sponsor Games. A player need not have a
Senator in Rome to take his regular Initiative. </p>
  <p><strong>7.21</strong> INITIATIVE: Once the HRAO has completed his
Initiative sequence, the other players in clockwise order do likewise
until all players have completed the sequence. Then any additional
Initiatives needed to bring the total number for that turn to six are
auctioned off (see <a href="#3.III">3.III</a>) to the highest bidder
and performed one at a time. Only those Senators currently in Rome
may bid for an extra Initiative and they must pay their bids from
their bids from their Personal Treasury. </p>
  <p><strong>7.3</strong> CARDS: There are two classes of cards.
Cards with black text are Forum cards and must be played face up in
the Forum when they are drawn. Cards with red text are Intrigue cards
and belong to the player who draws them. An Intrigue card must be
held secretly in a player's possession until he chooses to play it in
accordance with any restrictions pertaining to that card. A player
may never start a new turn with more than five unplayed Intrigue cards
(<a href="#11.1">11.1</a>). </p>
  <p><strong>7.31</strong> SENATORS: The number in the upper left is a
Senator's Military rating representing his ability as a
General/Admiral. The number in the upper right is the Oratory rating
representing his political skills. The number in the lower left is
his Loyalty rating measuring the degree of Allegiance to his current
situation (see also <a href="#7.511">7.511</a>). Some Statesmen have
two Loyalty ratings; a positive number or a 0 expressed as "#/0". The
0 is applicable if that Statesman belongs to the same faction as a
particular Statesman noted on his card. The number in the lower right
is his Influence and serves as a fluctuating gauge of his prestige.
This rating can be increased during the game by his public service or
reduced by his misdeeds. A Senator's current Influence is noted by
placement of the appropriate number markers in the lower right corner
of his card. This number is always positive; a Senator can never have
less than 0 Influence. The small number in the upper center of the
card is the Senator ID Number which corresponds with a like-numbered
Mortality Chit. if the ID is alpha-numeric, the Senator is a
Statesman (<a href="#7.312">7.312</a>). </p>
  <p>Senator cards also contain designated areas to record the
Senator's
Popularity, to note prior Consular experience whenever a Senator has
been named Consul or Dictator, and to stack each Senator's personal
Treasury (gold), or Knights (black) markers. If a Senator's
Popularity is negative, it is recorded with a black number marker. </p>
  <p><strong>7.311</strong> FAMILY: Senator cards represent leading
families in the Senate and are referred to as Family cards. Family
cards have black text and their ratings are expressed on the right
half of the card. new Family cards are added to a Faction only
through Persuasion Attempts (see <a href="#7.5">7.5</a>). Having a
particular Family card means a player has in his Faction the leading
member of that family. Should that Senator die, his place is taken by
the next leading member of that family who, if not a Faction Leader,
may change Factions or remain unaligned. Family cards with an ID
number in brackets "[]" include a prominent Statesman which may appear
during play. <a name="7.312"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.312"><strong>7.312</strong></a> STATESMEN: Senator
cards
with an alpha-numeric ID and red text represent outstanding individual
statesmen with special capabilities listed on the left side of their
cards. Statesmen also have a date printed beneath their ID#
approximating their lifespan (when known) or period of greatest
prominence. Statesmen can enter play only at game start (<a href="#4.7">4.7</a>)
or during the Revolution Phase prior to Revolt
declaration. A player can add his Statesman card to his Faction if: </p>
  <center><a name="7.312A"></a>
  <table border="0" width="90%">
    <tbody>
      <tr align="left" valign="top">
        <td>A.&nbsp;</td>
        <td>No opponent controls the related Family card. If the player
already controls the related Family card, the Statesman is placed on
top of it and takes over any current possessions and
Influence/Popularity ratings greater than his own. Any other printed
ratings of the Statesman which are less than that of the Family card
remain equal to the Statesman's printed rating. If the related Family
card is currently unaligned in the Forum, the Statesman is placed over
it and both cards are moved to that player's Faction. When the
Statesman dies, the Family card is returned to the Curia (or remains
in its Faction if the deceased had been a Faction leader) minus its
possessions and temporary ratings.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr align="left" valign="top">
        <td>B.&nbsp;</td>
        <td>The Family card with the same ID# is not currently in play.
If
the matching Family card subsequently appears, it is placed beneath
the Statesman until his death. It will then be returned to play as
per A above.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </center>
  <p>Most Statesmen may not enter play while a related Statesman (with
the same numerical ID) is in play (see <a href="#5.11">5.11</a>). </p>
  <p><strong>7.32</strong> CONCESSIONS: Concession cards represent
economic considerations such as collecting taxes or distributing
grain. A Concession is owned by the player who draws it from the
deck. He may assign it to one of his Senators at game start or during
a Revolution Phase (<a href="#11.1">11.1</a>) by placing it partially
beneath that Senator's card. That Senator is then entitled to collect
during the Revenue Phase the number of Talents listed on that
Concession. [EXCEPTIONS: In the case of the Armaments/Shipbuilding
concessions, the controlling Senator collects his profit immediately
when new Legions/Fleets are formed. The Land Commission Concession
produces income only when a Land Bill is in effect.] A Senator loses
a Concession due to his death/exile, a successful Minor Prosecution
(<a href="#9.411">9.411</a>), or due to certain Wars or Natural
Disasters. Whenever a Senator dies or is convicted, his Concessions
are returned to the Forum where they can be awarded to another Senator
by Senate vote. However, if the Concession itself was destroyed by a
War or Natural Disaster, it is returned to the Curia where an
end-of-Forum Phase dr of "5" or "6" is necessary to move it to the
Forum for reassignment. </p>
  <p><strong>7.33</strong> WARS: When a War card with an Armaments
symbol is drawn, that particular war or revolt has broken out. It
usually remains in effect until the Senate defeats it. The numbers
directly beneath the date represent its value in combat. The first
number is the enemy's Land Strength which represents the value of his
Army. The second number is the Fleet Support Number which indicates
the number of Roman Fleets, if any, required to support the war; it
never changes-regardless of the effects of Matching Wars. Fleets
usually do not affect odds computation but must be present in at least
the numbers specified for a War to be fought. The third number
present on some War cards represents enemy Fleet Strength which must
be defeated in a naval battle before conducting the land battle.
Enemy Land and Fleet Strength can double, triple, or even quadruple in
a Matching War (<a href="#7.332">7.332</a>). The alpha-numeric
numbers in the bottom corners of the card determine automatic
Disasters and Standoffs and are explained in the Combat section (<a
 href="#10.21">10.21</a>, <a href="#10.31">10.31</a>). </p>
  <p><strong>7.331</strong> INACTIVE WARS: All War cards without an
Armaments symbol are Inactive Wars. Although they remain in the Forum
when drawn, they are ignored until the Senate sends an Army to attack
them or they are activated by the Social War, their Leader, a matching
War of the same type (with an identical illustration), or a Leader
given Refuge. Place them in the "Inactive War" slots of the Forum
until activated. Once activated, their status is changed by movement
of the card to an Active War Forum slot. Each card lists how many
"matching" wars will activate it by reminding players of the
possibility of doubled, tripled, or quadrupled strength (see <a
 href="#7.332">7.332</a>). <a name="7.332"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.332"><strong>7.332</strong></a> MATCHING WARS:
Whenever two Wars of the same type (those with matching illustrations)
are in the Forum (e.g., two Punic Wars or two Pirates) the Strength
Numbers of each are doubled as long as the two remain in play. If a
third matching War is drawn, the Strength Numbers of all three are
tripled. If all four Macedonian War cards are in play at the same
time, their strength is quadrupled. However, each War card is fought
individually-not added to its related Wars. In these situations the
Strength Numbers of the remaining related Wars are reduced again to
tripled, doubled, or normal strength as their matching Wars are
individually vanquished. Matching Wars are each considered a separate
War contributing the effect of one separate War of the four required
to defeat Rome. Rome may not attack the latter of any currently
active Matching Wars unless she first prosecutes all earlier currently
active and related Matching Wars. </p>
  <p><font size="-1">EXAMPLE: Assume the 1st and 2nd Punic Wars are in
the Forum. Rome need not defeat the 1st Punic War in order to attack
the second, but she must attack it in the same turn she attacks the
2nd Punic War.</font> </p>
  <p><strong>7.3321</strong> TIME DELAY: Whenever a War or Revolt card
is drawn from the deck that would match a face-up War or Revolt card
already located in the Forum, the drawn card is placed face-down in an
Inactive War slot for the remainder of the current turn. If the
face-up card is currently located in an Inactive War slot, it is
immediately moved to an Active War slot; otherwise, face-up cards are
not affected in any way. At the beginning of each new turn, before
any other action is taken, all cards in Inactive War slots are turned
face-up, and one card for each War or Revolt is moved to an Active War
slot on the Forum. Wars should be selected for activation in
chronological order (e.g. 1st Macedonian before 2nd Macedonian)
whenever possible. An Inactive War and its Leader are instantly
matched and activated; there is no delay. If a Leader is drawn that
matches an Active War, the Leader is immediately placed on the Active
War card - but no additional War cards are activated. </p>
  <p><font size="-1">EXAMPLE: First Punic War begins the game face-up
in
an Inactive War slot. Second Punic War is drawn; it is placed
face-down in an Inactive War slot, and the First Punic War is moved to
an Active War slot. Third Punic War is drawn in the same turn; it is
placed face-down in an Inactive War slot. The Hannibal Leader card is
then drawn; it is immediately placed with the active First Punic War.
At the start of Turn 2, Second Punic War is moved to an Active War
slot, but Third Punic War remains Inactive until the start of Turn 3.
If the Hamilcar Leader card is drawn during either turn, it would be
placed with an active Punic War card. Third Punic War would remain
Inactive.</font> </p>
  <p><strong>7.333</strong> PIRATES: Pirates have the impact of a
Drought (see <a href="#7.353">7.353</a>). As long as Pirates are
present (even if inactive), Drought conditions continue and the Unrest
Level is increased by one at the start of each Population Phase. If
both Pirates cards are present, the Unrest Level is increased by two
each Population Phase. </p>
  <p><strong>7.334</strong> CONSEQUENCES: A War need not be fought
immediately, but for each active War card in the Forum during the
Revenue Phase, the state loses 20 Talents. If, at the end of any
Combat Phase, there are four active Wars, the Republic collapses and
all players lose. Inactive Wars do not count against the four-war
limit or the revenue drain until activated. Any active War card in
the Forum not containing a Legion marker at the end of the Combat
Phase is moved to one of the three "Unprosecuted War" slots at the
bottom of the Forum-until it ends a combat Phase with a Legion upon
it. The Unrest Level increases by one for each Unprosecuted War
during each Population Phase. </p>
  <p><strong>7.335</strong> REVOLTS: A Revolt is the equal of a War
for all purposes except that no Spoils of War are created by a
defeated Revolt. Many Revolt cards are conditional; i.e., they are
treated as Revolts if a named Province currently exists at the time of
being drawn, but are treated as Wars of Events if it does not.
Whenever the last War in a numbered series of Matching Wars is
defeated, any previous War in that series is thereafter treated as a
Revolt. </p>
  <p><font size="-1">EXAMPLE: If the 3rd Punic War is defeated, the 1st
and 2nd Punic Wars are considered Revolts.</font> <a name="7.34"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.34"><strong>7.34</strong></a> LEADERS: Leader cards
represent the appearance of a particularly able enemy commander.
Their presence makes a war more difficult to prosecute. If, while a
war is in effect, a matching Leader card is drawn (e.g., Hannibal is
drawn while Punic Wars are in effect), the Land and Fleet Strength
Number(s) of the current War(s) is increased by his value (after any
relevant doubling or tripling for Matching Wars). The Leader card is
not discarded until all of its Matching War(s) are defeated. If a
Leader is drawn when none of its Matching Wars are currently in play,
it is left on display in the Curia indicating that individual has
reached prominence in his native land. At the end of each Forum
Phase, an Aging dr must be made for each Leader in the Forum without a
Matching War in play. If the dr is a "5" or "6", that Leader dies and
is discarded. The numbers in the bottom corners of the Leader card
determine automatic Roman Disasters/Standoffs (<a href="#10.21">10.21</a>/<a
 href="10.31">10.31</a>) directly
attributable to the skill of the Leader and are added to those in
effect for the War itself. </p>
  <p><strong>7.341</strong> CLEOPATRA: Cleopatra is a special Leader
card which is holdable in a player's hand as an Intrigue card. The
holder of Cleopatra may play it only prior to Combat resolution of the
Alexandrine War. If played as an Ally, the Commander of the Roman
force sent against the Alexandrine War increases his Military Rating
against that War by 3 and gains 50 Talents, but loses five Popularity.
If played as an Enemy, it is placed in the Forum and increases the
Alexandrine War strength in the normal manner. <a name="7.35"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.35"><strong>7.35</strong></a> EVENTS: Before taking his
Initiative, each player must make a DR to see if he triggers a Random
Event. If he rolls a "7", he must make a TDR on the Random Events
Table and place the gray Event card corresponding to the TDR in play.
If that Event card is already in play, it is flipped to its pink side.
Events (with the exception of uncollected Bequests (<a href="#7.351">7.351</a>),
unused Refuge, and an inactive Pretender)
remain in effect only until the Forum Phase of the following Game Turn
when they are removed and become eligible for reappearance. Except
for Epidemics, Evil Omens, Droughts, manpower Shortages, Storms at
Sea, and Mob Violence, any result matching that of a pink event
already in play is treated as no further effect but nonetheless
prevents the drawing of another Forum/Event card by that player. <a
 name="7.351"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.351"><strong>7.351</strong></a> BEQUESTS: Bequests and
the Catiline Conspiracy are the only Event cards which are drawn
normally. The State Treasury collects the amount of the Bequest if a
Field Consul and at least three Legions and three Fleets are
dispatched to bring them to Rome. In so doing, they create the
Province listed on that card. If, however, the Consul sent out
declares himself in revolt, he controls the money. Otherwise, he
returns to Rome in the Revolution Phase, his Legions are returned to
the Active Box, and the money is awarded to the state in the
immediately following Revenue Phase. Bequest cards remain in play in
the Forum until collected. The Ptolemy-Apion Bequest requires no such
action, and the Province of Crete-Cyrene is established as soon as the
card is drawn. <a name="7.352"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.352"><strong>7.352</strong></a> BARBARIAN RAIDS:
Barbarian incursions along the frontier threaten the outlying
Provinces. At the START of the next Revenue Phase, the Governor of
each <u>underscored</u> Province with a solid black border silhouette
must make a Raid DR <font face="symbol">&sup3;</font> 15 after adding
the existing Military Force of the Province to prevent an Overrun.
The Province's Military Force vs Raids is its printed Strength plus
two for each Garrison Legion, plus 1 for each Provincial Army, plus
the Military Rating of the Governor (regardless of his Province's
forces). An Overrun results in the loss of all Revenue from that
Province during that turn plus force losses equal to the colored dr of
the Raid DR (up to the maximum of forces present in the Province). In
addition, an Overrun Developed Province reverts to its gray
Undeveloped state. No Development dr can be made that run. The
Governor is killed only as a result of a Mortality chit drawn due to
force loss (<a href="#10.8">10.8</a>) caused by an Overrun. However,
in this case, the number of Mortality chits drawn are not dependent on
actual units lost, but rather is equal to the colored dr of the Raid
DR. <a name="7.353"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.353"><strong>7.353</strong></a> DROUGHT: Drought
increases the Unrest Level by one. During the next Revenue Phase,
income on grain concessions may be doubled, but any Senator who
collects doubled income loses two Popularity. If Pirates (and/or
certain Wars which also create "man-made" Drought conditions) are also
in play at the same time as a Drought, grain concession income and the
Popularity penalties for collecting it are increased by one multiple
in each instance. Manmade droughts which are not Events, but part of
an ongoing War are not necessarily one-turn conditions-they are
continuous until the Pirates/War are defeated. Should a third Drought
occur during the same turn, place a "3" marker on the pink Drought
card to symbolize its increased severity. </p>
  <p>A player does not have to collect increased revenue for his Grain
concession; he may always opt to collect less to reduce the impact on
his Popularity correspondingly. </p>
  <p><font size="-1">EXAMPLE: A Drought and a Pirate card are in the
Forum. The Unrest Level will increase by two at the start of the
Population Phase. Any Grain concession income is tripled. A Senator
taking this tripled income loses three Popularity. If the Sicilian
Slave Revolt is also drawn, the Unrest Level will increase by three
instead of two, and potential Grain Concession income will be
quadrupled at the cost of -4 Popularity. If both Pirates, a Drought,
and the Sicilian Slave Revolt are drawn, the Unrest Level will increase
by four and the potential Grain Concession income will be quintupled
at the cost of -5 Popularity.</font> </p>
  <p><strong>7.354</strong> EPIDEMIC: A new Mortality Check (<a
 href="#5.1">5.1</a>) is made by drawing six Mortality Chits. Only
those Senators currently in Rome can be affected. If further
Epidemics are rolled in the same Forum Phase, they reflect a foreign
plague which kills only the first Governor, Proconsul, Exile, Captive
or rebel drawn for each Epidemic who is currently away from Rome. </p>
  <p><strong>7.355</strong> EVIL OMENS: Evil portents suggest the Gods
are not amused, and Rome suffers a year of bad luck. The State
Treasury must immediately pay 20 Talents for sacrifices and Temple
repair, and until the next Forum Phase one must be subtracted from
EVERY die and dice roll except the Initiative DR (<a href="#7.2">7.2</a>)
[Exception: One must be ADDED to Persuasion
Attempts (<a href="#7.51">7.51</a>)]. Further Evil Omens in the same
turn do not increase the Talent payment, but do increase the adverse
dice modifiers. <a name="7.356"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.356"><strong>7.356</strong></a> MANPOWER SHORTAGE: The
cost of raising new Legions and Fleets during this Game Turn is
doubled to 20 Talents each. If an additional Manpower Shortage is in
effect due to the Population Table or a previous Manpower Shortage
Event in the same turn, the cost is increased by 10 Talents for each
instance. If a third Manpower Shortage occurs in the same turn, place
a "3" marker on the card and the cost increases to 40 Talents each. <a
 name="7.357"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.357"><strong>7.357</strong></a> NATURAL DISASTER: The
State Treasury must immediately pay 50 Talents for relief. A dr must
be made and the indicated Concession must be returned to the Curia
face down. If the rolled Concession is already destroyed or inactive
there is no additional effect. Only one Natural Disaster requiring a
50 Talent payment may occur per turn, but if a second Natural Disaster
event is rolled, a second Concession must be destroyed by making
another dr on the Natural Disaster card.. </p>
  <p><strong>7.358</strong> STORM AT SEA: Roman Fleets equal in number
to a DR are eliminated (up to a maximum of those currently in play).
There is no effect on Legions although some may have to be withdrawn
to Italy for lack of support if sufficient additional Fleets cannot be
raised during the Senate Phase. A storm has no effect on the
construction of new Fleets. </p>
  <p><strong>7.359</strong> INTERNAL DISORDER: Each undeveloped (gray)
Province has no Revenue in the next Revenue Phase and may not attempt
an Improvement dr (<a href="#6.14">6.14</a>). The Governor of each
undeveloped Province must make a DR &gt; 4 at the start of the Revenue
Phase (following resolution of any Barbarian Raids) to prevent a
Revolt. The Governor receives a +1 DRM for each Garrison Legion he
has. A successful Revolt kills the Governor and his Garrison and
moves the Province card to the Forum as an active War along with any
Provincial forces it may already have (14.411). </p>
  <p><strong>7.36</strong> INTRIGUE CARDS: Red cards (Statesmen,
Concessions, and Intrigue) may be held secretly in a player's
possession for play at his convenience. A player may show his red
cards to whomever he chooses in hopes of encouraging an agreement or
favorable action. </p>
  <p><strong>7.361</strong> TRIBUNES: Tribunes may be used to initiate
or veto proposals (see <a href="#9.7">9.7</a>). </p>
  <p><strong>7.362</strong> STATESMEN: Red Senator cards represent
Statesmen of outstanding ability with special capabilities listed on
their card. An unplayed Statesman is not subject to Mortality Chit
draws. </p>
  <p><strong>7.363</strong> LAWS: Law cards represent changes in the
rules governing the Republic and play of the game. Once played, the
rules affected apply to all subsequent play-not just the player of the
card. Display played Law cards in the Law box rather than mixing them
with the Discards. Law cards may be played anytime during the Senate
Phase-even before elections. A player need not have a Senator present
in Rome to play a Law card. <a name="7.37"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.37"><strong>7.37</strong></a> TRADE: Players may trade
and/or give away only their <em>held (i.e., not yet played)</em> red
cards-usually in exchange for certain favors. Players may show their
cards, agree to the terms of trade, and even exchange cards at other
times, but the traded cards cannot be played prior to the next
Revolution Phase. If cards change hands outside the Revolution Phase,
they must be placed beneath the board edge until the Revolution Phase
as a reminder of their unplayable status. Any Talent payment as part
of these trades must wait until the next Revenue Phase-even if the
card is transferred immediately. Due to the volatile emotions such
trades can create when the parties disagree over whether the terms of
the trade have been honored, the following rules apply. </p>
  <p><strong>7.371</strong> SECRET AGREEMENT: Players who discuss
their deals in private have no recourse when a trade partner fails to
honor the terms of any agreement. Such a betrayal is considered a
legitimate game tactic and not a form of "cheating". Caveat Emptor. </p>
  <p><strong>7.372</strong> OPEN TRADES: Players who discuss their
bargain for all to hear can rely on the truthful testimony of the
other players to enforce the provisions of any trade. If the majority
agrees that the terms of the agreement were not fulfilled, the wronged
party can rescind those aspects of the trade that are still being held
(and are therefore retrievable). Virtually anything that does not
circumvent the rules can be agreed to in such a deal, offers to
concede a particular Consulship to a co-Consul are never enforceable,
nor is any deal involving an Assassination attempt, or guaranteed
Passage of any vote. </p>
  <p><font size="-1">EXAMPLE: During the Senate Phase, X agrees in open
discussion to give Y five Talents, a Tribune card, and a Concession in
exchange for Y's promise that his Rome Consul will propose Julius for
Censor and vote for his election. Y does as promised. However, the
Rome Consul calls upon X to vote first for his own election whereas X
wants to vote last to assure passage. The measure is defeated when
player Z spends money to buy votes to defeat it. X protests that the
bargain was not kept, but the other players agree with Y that nothing
was said about a specific voting order and the trade stands. Y keeps
the cards and is entitled to five Talents from X during the next
Revenue Phase. X gets nothing except heartburn.</font> </p>
  <p><strong>7.4</strong> GAMES: Sponsoring Games allows a Senator to
increase his Popularity while lowering the Unrest Level of the
populace. The player pays the required cost of the type of Games he
wishes to sponsor as listed on the Games Table from the Senator's
Personal Treasury and then adjusts his Popularity by placing an
appropriately numbered marker on his card in the Popularity space. <a
 name="7.5"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.5"><strong>7.5</strong></a> PERSUASION ATTEMPTS: A
Senator in Rome may attempt to persuade an unaligned Senator in the
Forum or an already Aligned Senator also in Rome to join his own
Faction. <a name="7.51"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.51"><strong>7.51</strong></a> RESOLUTION: The Senator
making the Persuasion Attempt adds his Oratory and Influence and
subtracts from this sum the target Senator's Loyalty rating. The
resulting Base Number, which may be modified in the ways outlined
below, is then compared to a DR. If the DR is <font face="symbol">&pound;</font>
the Base Number, the Persuasion Attempt
succeeds and the target Senator joins the Faction of the Senator
making the Persuasion Attempt. If the original DR is <font
 face="symbol">&sup3;</font> 10 or if the modified DR is &gt; the Base
Number the Persuasion Attempt fails and the target Senator remains
either uncommitted or aligned to his current Faction as the case may
be. <a name="7.511"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.511"><strong>7.511</strong></a> LOYALTY: If the target
Senator is already Aligned, seven is added to his Loyalty rating. The
number of Talents in the Personal Treasury of the target Senator,
whether Aligned or not, is added to his Loyalty rating. If two
Statesmen who opposed each other historically belong to the same
Faction the Loyalty rating of both is reduced to "0" until one leaves
the Faction. A player may voluntarily abandon such a Statesman by
placing his card in the Forum provided he does not do so during an
announced Persuasion Attempt. </p>
  <p><strong>7.512</strong> BRIBES: The Senator making the Persuasion
Attempt may spend money from his Personal Treasury to aid the
Persuasion Attempt. Each Talent spent adds one to the Base Number.
This money is paid into the Personal Treasury of the target Senator at
the end of the attempt, regardless of the outcome. </p>
  <p><strong>7.513</strong> COUNTER-BRIBES: All players may interfere
in a Persuasion Attempt made against a Senator by spending money from
their Faction Treasuries to aid or resist the Persuasion Attempt.
Each Talent thus spent subtracts one from the Base Number. This money
is paid into the Personal Treasury of the target Senator at the end of
the attempt, regardless of the outcome. If an Unopposed Persuasion
Attempt is called for, this type of interference is not allowed and the
target Senator must defend strictly with his Loyalty rating and
Personal Treasury. </p>
  <p><strong>7.514</strong> BIDDING: The Senator making the
Persuasion Attempt announces his target and the initial Base Number,
which may already reflect money irrevocably spent from his Personal
Treasury. Play then moves clockwise around the table, and each player
in turn announces the Talents, if any, he is irrevocably spending from
his Faction Treasury to resist the Persuasion Attempt. The player
making the Persuasion Attempt may then either make a DR at the present
Base Number or irrevocably spend more Talents, with bidding moving
around the table again. This cycle of bidding continues until all
players stop spending money or the Persuader accepts the current Base
Number. Money thus spent should be initially placed on the table in
front of a player's Faction (the Banker making change as necessary)
and transferred to the target Senator's card only after the Persuasion
Attempt is resolved. </p>
  <p><font size="-1">EXAMPLE: Fabius wishes to make a persuasion
Attempt
against Claudius, who is an uncommitted Senator in the Forum. Fabius
adds his Oratory and Influence ratings and gets a sum of seven, from
which he subtracts Claudius' Loyalty rating of "7" to produce a Base
Number of "0". Fabius spends nine Talents from his Personal Treasury
to bring the Base Number up to "9". Play then moves around the table,
and the other players spend a total of eight Talents from their
collective Faction Treasuries to lower the Base Number to "1". Fabius
responds by spending the seven Talents remaining in his Personal
Treasury to raise the Base Number to "8". Play revolves around the
table again, but this time the other players are unwilling or unable
to spend any more money so the final Base Number is "8". Fabius rolls
a "9" which is not <font face="symbol">&pound;</font> "8", so the
Persuasion Attempt fails and Claudius remains uncommitted. All the
money spent on the Persuasion Attempt it placed in Claudius' Personal
Treasury, making him both more attractive and harder to get, since the
24 Talents now in his Personal Treasury are automatically added to his
Loyalty rating in any future Persuasion Attempts.</font> </p>
  <p><strong>7.6</strong> KNIGHTS: A player may attempt to attract one
Knight per Initiative to one of his Aligned Senators in Rome by paying
zero to six Talents from that Senator's Personal Treasury and rolling
a die. If the sum of the die roll and the number of Talents paid is <font
 face="symbol">&sup3;</font> 6, a Knight is attracted and that
Senator places a Knight marker on his card indicating the total number
of Knights he controls. There is no limit to the number of Knights
that may eventually be controlled by a Senator. For each Knight a
Senator attracts he gains an extra vote in the Senate and an extra
Talent of income during the Revenue Phase (unless he is in Revolt). <a
 name="7.61"></a></p>
  <p><a name="7.61"><strong>7.61</strong></a> PRESSURING KNIGHTS:
During
his Initiative a player, instead of rolling to attract a Knight, may
opt to pressure those he has for contributions and in so doing loses
their support. He announces how many of his Knights he will pressure,
returns them to the Bank, and rolls a die for each to determine the
amount of Talents gained. This money must be added to the controlling
Senator's Personal Treasury. </p>
  <p><strong>7.7</strong> FACTION LEADER: Faction Leaders are immune
to Persuasion Attempts. <a name="POPULATION"><font color="#ee0000">
  <h3>8. POPULATION
PHASE</h3>
  </font></a></p>
  <p><strong>8.1</strong> UNREST: The Unrest Level represents the
degree of dissatisfaction of the populace with the government. The
Unrest Level starts at "0". At the start of each Population Phase it
is increased by one for each Pirate (whether active or not), Drought,
or Unprosecuted War present in the Forum. If a Pirate War is active
and Unprosecuted it would add two to the Unrest Level. The Unrest
Level is also increased by one whenever Rome suffers a Disaster in
battle (even a naval battle) and by two whenever Rome suffers a
Defeat. It is lowered immediately by Victory in War (including naval
battles), sponsoring games, or passing Land Bills. There is no limit
to how high the Unrest Level can go, but it can never go lower than 0.
To show an Unrest Level higher than 9, add a 10 Talent piece next to
the Unrest Level marker. </p>
  <p><font size="-1">EXAMPLE: +20 would be shown by a 20 Talent piece
next to the Unrest Level marker on the "0" space.</font> <a name="8.2"></a></p>
  <p><a name="8.2"><strong>8.2</strong></a> STATE OF THE REPUBLIC: The
HRAO gives a State of the Republic speech by making a TDR, subtracting
the Unrest Level, and adding his Popularity. The resultant sum is
found on the Population Table to determine the result. The numbers on
the Population Table indicate the amount the Unrest Level is to be
immediately increased or decreased. A result of "NR" (No Recruitment)
prohibits the formation of new Legions/Fleets this Game Turn. "MS"
(Manpower Shortage) has the same effect as the Event card (<a
 href="#7.356">7.356</a>) and is cumulative with any currently in the
Forum. "Mob" results in an assault on the Senate by an outraged mob
which is resolved by drawing six Mortality Chits to check among those
currently in Rome to determine the Senators killed. "People Revolt"
results in an overthrow of the Senatorial government and defeat for
all players if no Civil War exists. If one player is currently in
revolt, he wins (barring loss due to four Wars; <a href="#12.32">12.32</a>).
"Manpower Shortage" or "No Recruiting"
results should be recorded with the appropriate marker on the
Population Table display until the next Population Phase. <a
 name="SENATE"><font color="#ee0000">
  <h3>9. SENATE
PHASE</h3>
  </font></a></p>
  <p><strong>9.1</strong> HIGHEST RANKING AVAILABLE OFFICIAL (HRAO):
The HRAO is the highest ranking official in Rome. The order of
precedence of officials is listed on their office marker and is as
follows: 1. Dictator, 2. Rome Consul, 3. Field Consul, 4. Censor,
5. Master of Horse, 6. Pontifex Maximus. If none of these officials
is available due to death or absence from Rome, the Senator with the
most Influence opens the meeting (using Oratory ratings to break
ties). Al Senators in Rome (i.e., everyone except Governors,
Proconsuls (<a href="#10.7">10.7</a>), Exiles, Captives and rebel
Senators) must attend the Senate meeting. </p>
  <p><strong>9.11</strong> PRESIDING MAGISTRATE: The Senator who
convened the Senate is the Presiding Magistrate until the election of
a new Rome Consul or Dictator. The Presiding Magistrate has compete
control over the procedures of the Senate and with the exception of
Prosecutions (see <a href="#9.41">9.41</a>) conducts all business. He
may recognize Senators in any order he wishes and may call for the
votes of each Faction in any order. He alone makes nominations and
proposals without the use of a Tribune card, and he may break off
discussion on any proposal by calling for an immediate vote. Any
player who ignores his demand for an immediate vote is considered to
have abstained and loses his right to vote on that proposal. After
all elections and Prosecutions, he may close the meeting at any time
there is no unresolved proposal on the floor by stating "the Senate is
adjourned". </p>
  <p><strong>9.2</strong> ELECTIONS: The first act of any Presiding
Magistrate must be to conduct elections for new Consuls from among the
ranks of Aligned Senators. There are no minimum qualifications for
Consul. However, a Consul may not succeed himself in consecutive
turns. A Senator may not hold two offices simultaneously, but the
current Censor may be elected Consul with the understanding that he
will not continue to serve as Censor. </p>
  <p><strong>9.21</strong> NOMINATIONS: Only the Presiding Magistrate
may nominate candidates without using a Tribune, although he may
accept suggestions from other players. He must nominate candidates in
pairs. Any pair of candidates that is defeated may not be nominated
again that turn as the same pair, but the individuals making up the
defeated pair may be nominated again as part of a new pair.
Candidates are elected or defeated as a pair; one cannot be elected
while the other is defeated in the same vote. </p>
  <p><strong>9.22</strong> TRIBUNES: Other Senators may force
proposals to a vote only by using a Tribune. This may be done any
time there is no proposal already on the floor, or it can be played
during a current proposal with or without specifying intent so as to
establish that player's right to make the next proposal. A Tribune
can also be played immediately after the Presiding Magistrate adjourns
the meeting to force its continuation to consider the Tribune's
Proposal. Some Statesmen have the capability of playing an inherent
Tribune each turn without actually playing a card. </p>
  <p><strong>9.23</strong> AUTOMATIC ELECTION: Nominations continue
until two Consuls are elected or until only one possible pair of
candidates remains, in which case this final pair is elected. </p>
  <p><strong>9.24</strong> ELIGIBILITY: To be nominated, a Senator
must be in Rome and not hold any office (except Censor). This
prevents outgoing Consuls from nominating themselves as incoming
Consuls. A Senator may not decline a nomination although he may vote
against himself. </p>
  <p><strong>9.25</strong> ROME/FIELD CONSUL: The newly elected
Consuls decide amongst them who will be Rome Consul. If they cannot
agree, each makes a DR with the high roller gaining choice of office.
Place the appropriate Consul markers on their respective cards and
immediately increase their Influence by five. This Influence gain
(like most Influence gains for taking office) is not lost when the
Senator ceases to be Consul but is his to keep until lost by some form
of misdeed. The new Rome Consul becomes Presiding Magistrate and takes
over conduct of the meeting. The prior Consuls place a "Consular
Experience" marker in the "Prior Consul" box of their card. </p>
  <p><strong>9.3</strong> VOTING: After announcing the proposal, the
Presiding Magistrate chooses a Faction to vote first. That Faction
must vote, abstain, or use a Tribune to cancel the vote. After that
Faction votes or abstains, the Presiding Magistrate selects another
Faction to vote and the process is repeated until all Factions have
had an opportunity to vote or the proposal is vetoed. The voting
procedure of the Senate is the same for all business requiring a vote
except that abstaining is not allowed during the passage/repeal of a
Land Bill. Any player refusing to vote on a Land Bill when
prompted is considered to have voted against it or for its repeal. </p>
  <p><strong>9.31</strong> VOTES: Each Senator in Rome controls votes
equal to his Oratory plus the number of Knights he controls. However,
he may temporarily increase his votes for any particular proposal by
buying them. For each Talent he pays out of his Personal Treasury
(back to the Bank) he receives one extra vote for that round of
voting. Players should keep a running tally of the total current
votes (less bribes and Senators away from Rome) of each Faction
displayed with the number markers in their Faction Treasury. </p>
  <p><strong>9.32</strong> BLOCK VOTES: All the Senators in a Faction
need not vote alike, though they usually will. Once a Senator (or
entire Faction) declares his vote he may not change it, nor play a
Tribune to cancel the vote. </p>
  <p><strong>9.33</strong> PASSAGE: A simple majority (&gt; 50%) of
votes cast is required to pass any measure. <a name="9.34"></a></p>
  <p><a name="9.34"><strong>9.34</strong></a> LOSS OF INFLUENCE:
Whenever the Presiding Magistrate makes a nomination or major proposal
which is defeated by unanimous vote of all Senators in Rome controlled
by the other players, he loses one Influence (down to a minimum of 0)
unless he steps down as Presiding Magistrate and hands conduct of the
meeting over to the next HRAO. </p>
  <p><strong>9.4</strong> CENSOR: Immediately after election of the
new consuls, the Presiding Magistrate conducts elections for Censor.
Candidates must be prior Consuls. The Censor may succeed himself. If
only one eligible Candidate of Consular experience is available (as
usually happens on the first turn), he is elected automatically. If
there are no Senators of Consular experience present in the Senate
and free of other offices, the election for Censor is temporarily
thrown open to all Senators in Rome. </p>
  <p>Each time a Censor is elected, the Censor marker is placed on that
Senator's card and his Influence increases by five. The Presiding
Magistrate now turns the conduct of the meeting over to the Censor
temporarily to conduct any Prosecutions. <a name="9.41"></a></p>
  <p><a name="9.41"><strong>9.41</strong></a> PROSECUTIONS: The Censor
either declares no Prosecutions and returns conduct of the meeting to
the Presiding Magistrate or announces a Prosecution. He may conduct
up to two Minor or one Major Prosecution each turn in addition to any
special Prosecutions of Assassins. During Prosecutions, the Censor is
the Presiding Magistrate and conducts all voting. If the majority of
votes are against conviction, the accused goes free and may not be
prosecuted again this Game Turn for the same office, Concession, or
Assassination attempt. During a Prosecution, the accused receives
additional votes equal to his Influence. <a name="9.411"></a></p>
  <p><a name="9.411"><strong>9.411</strong></a> MINOR PROSECUTIONS: The
accused must have held an office during the previous Game Turn or
collected income from a Concession. If convicted, the accused loses
five Popularity (which can become negative) and five Influence (to a
minimum of 0) as well as any Prior Consul marker, and must return all
of his Concessions to the Forum. </p>
  <p><strong>9.412</strong> PROSECUTOR: The Censor must appoint another
consenting Senator to be Prosecutor for each Prosecution. If
successful in his Prosecution (either by conviction or exile), the
Prosecutor gains any Prior Consul marker of the defendant plus half
(fractions rounded up) of any Influence lost by the defendant due to
the Prosecution. </p>
  <p><strong>9.42</strong> MAJOR PROSECUTIONS: The accused must have
held an office other than a Governorship during the previous Game
Turn. If the majority of votes are for conviction, the accused is
executed unless he has already gone into exile. </p>
  <p><strong>9.421</strong> EXILE: Any <em>Statesmen</em> undergoing a
Major Prosecution may, during his Faction's turn to vote, go into
voluntary exile instead of voting. He may make a Popular Appeal
before deciding to vote or flee. Once he votes, however, the option
to go into exile is lost. A Statesman in exile loses all income
except that presently in his Personal Treasury which is frozen until
recalled. He may not receive or give money from his Personal
Treasury. He may retain any Knights and Legion Allegiance markers
pending his recall but may not vote nor receive income while in exile.
He loses all Prior Consul markers, Concessions, Priesthoods, positive
Popularity, and Influence except that printed on his card. </p>
  <p><strong>9.422</strong> LIFE IN EXILE: A Statesman in exile is
marked with an Exile marker in his Prior Consul space which signifies
his absence from Rome. He has no effect until recalled except to
fulfill death requirements of a Mortality Chit draw or Foreign
Epidemic. The Family card of a Statesman in exile is treaded as if
the Statesman had died (<a href="#5.2">5.2</a>) except that a
Mortality Chit draw during the Mortality Phase must be diced for to
determine whether it effects the Statesman in exile or the Family card
if the Family card remains in play. </p>
  <p><strong>9.423</strong> RECALL FROM EXILE: A Statesman may return
from exile only by vote of the Senate. If recalled, he returns to the
Forum unless his Family card is currently aligned with a Faction in
which case he replaces it normally (<a href="#7.312A">7.312A</a>) or in
the case of the Licinii/Grachii joins the Faction of his related
Statesman (<a href="#5.11">5.11</a>). However, the Faction which cast
the most votes for his recall may make one immediate Unopposed
Persuasion Attempt and control him by rolling <font face="symbol">&pound;</font>
his Loyalty rating. If successful, he and
his Family card are controlled by that Faction. </p>
  <p><strong>9.43</strong> OFFENSE: The offices that render a Senator
liable to prosecution are Dictator, Master of Horse, Consul,
Proconsul, Censor, and Pontifex Maximus. A Governor may be prosecuted
only upon the turn of his return to Rome and only if he has taken
personal income from his Province at any time during his term. <a
 name="9.44"></a></p>
  <p><a name="9.44"><strong>9.44</strong></a> POPULAR APPEAL: A Senator
accused in a Prosecution may, when his Faction is called upon to vote,
appeal to the people by making a DR, adding the result to his
Popularity, and finding the sum on the Popular Appeal Table. The
result is the amount of additional votes (or less votes in the case of
a negative number) the accused has for the vote on his Prosecution.
"Accused Killed" means the populace is so disgusted by the
self-serving rhetoric of the accused that they kill him themselves.
Conversely, a result of "Accused Freed" ends the Prosecution with an
acquittal and a drawing of one Mortality chit for each number by which
the modified DR exceeds 11 to see if either the Censor and/or the
Prosecutor (the only two vulnerable to the chit draw) is killed by a
mob enraged over this obvious frame-up. A Senator who makes a Popular
Appeal and is not killed as a result may still go into exile or play a
Tribune to veto the Prosecution after discovering the result of his
appeal. </p>
  <p><strong>9.45</strong> TRIBUNE: A Senator accused in any
Prosecution (or one of his friends) may also play a Tribune during his
Faction's vote and cancel the Prosecution. The cancelled Prosecution
still counts towards the Censor's total allowed Prosecutions for that
Game Turn. </p>
  <p><strong>9.46</strong> END OF PROSECUTIONS: Upon completion of his
Prosecutions, the Censor turns the meeting back to the HRAO. </p>
  <p><strong>9.5</strong> REPOPULATING ROME: Whenever the number of
Aligned Senators currently in Rome falls below eight during a Senate
Phase due to death or absence, the top Senator card in the Curia is
promoted to active status in the Faction of the player with the fewest
Active Senators. Ties are resolved in favor of the player with the
least total Influence currently in Rome. Such promotions continue
until the number of active Senators in Rome reaches eight or the Curia
is empty. If the Curia has no Senators, those in the Forum can be
substituted. The choice of which of multiple Senators are currently
to take is up to the receive player. If no further Senators are
currently available in either the Curia or the Forum, no such
promotion occurs. </p>
  <p><strong>9.6</strong> OTHER BUSINESS: The Presiding Magistrate may
now conduct other business by proposing whatever motions he wishes.
Other Senators may place motions on the floor only by playing a
Tribune, although the Presiding Magistrate may sponsor their
suggestions if he wishes. The voting is always conducted by the
Presiding Magistrate, regardless of who makes the Proposal. Except
for the multiple election of Consuls or Governors, and the
simultaneous awarding of Concessions, each proposal may address only
one matter at a time. For example, a proposal could not group a Land
Bill with a Concession vote to increase the chances of passage. The
Presiding Magistrate may close the meeting whenever he chooses, as long
as there is no unresolved motion on the floor. He simply states the
"Senate is adjourned" and thereby ends the opportunity for
Assassinations. </p>
  <p><strong>9.61</strong> CONCESSIONS: Attempts to assign Concessions
present in the Forum may be made by proposing a specific Concession
(or group of Concessions) be assigned to one (or more) specific
Senator(s) present at the meeting. Group proposals may be made
assigning different Concessions to different Senators to increase
voting support. If a proposal to assign a concession fails (whether
singly or as part of a group), that Concession card(s) is flipped over
to its reverse side and may not be proposed again during that Game
Turn. There is no limit to the number of Concessions a Senator may
control. The Land Commission Concession may only be assigned if a Land
Bill is in effect; once assigned it must be returned to the Forum if
there are no Land Bills in effect at the end of a Senate Phase. </p>
  <p><strong>9.611</strong> DESTROYED CONCESSIONS: Concessions
currently in play are destroyed only under the following
circumstances. </p>
  <center>
  <table border="0" width="90%">
    <tbody>
      <tr align="left" valign="top">
        <td>A.&nbsp;</td>
        <td>During the Senate Phase of each turn of the Gladiator Slave
Revolt
and Second Punic War, a dr is made to determine which area of Italy is
being laid waste and consequently which Tax Farmer Concession has been
destroyed. If Spartacus or Hannibal is also present, a second dr is
made each turn to determine further possible Tax Farmer
losses.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr align="left" valign="top">
        <td>B.&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Grain Concessions are destroyed when the Sicilian or

      </tr>
      <tr align="left" valign="top">
        <td>C.&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Other Concessions may be destroyed by the required
subsequent dr
of a Natural Disaster (<a href="#7.357">7.357</a>).</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </center>
  <p>When a Concession is destroyed, it is placed face-down in the
Concession space of the Curia. At the end of each subsequent Forum
Phase, the HRAO makes a dr for each destroyed Concession, returning
those for which he rolls a "5" or "6" face-up to the Forum. These
Concessions, like dead Senators, may be assigned again in a subsequent
Senate Phase. </p>
  <p><strong>9.62</strong> GOVERNORSHIPS: When a Province is created,
place its card in the Forum. Each Province in the Forum has a
Governorship which the Senate must fill from among its membership
during the next Senate Phase. Elections for all open Governorships
are conducted immediately after Prosecutions and before conducting
other business. Elections continue until a Governor is selected or
there is only one eligible candidate remaining. When a Governor is
elected, the Province card is placed on his Senator card, and he must
leave Rome immediately without participating in any remaining Senate
votes. Elections for multiple Governorships may be held
simultaneously, as with Consular elections, so that Governors will be
elected (or rejected) in tandem and depart at the same time, but no
other proposal may be added to the same vote. A Governor can hold no
other office. </p>
  <p><strong>9.621</strong> TERM: All Governorships are for a period
of three years. Place a Term marker in the Term box of the Governor
card and reduce it by one at the end of each Revenue Phase. When the
marker moves off the Term Track, the Governor returns to Rome (unless
he has previously declared himself in revolt). He may not be
re-elected to that or another Governorship without his consent during
the turn of his return. </p>
  <p><strong>9.622</strong> RECALL: During the term of his
Governorship, a Senator is absent from Rome and cannot attend Senate
meetings (and vote). A Governor may be recalled in time for the next
Senate vote by electing a new Governor, but never in the same year he
was elected. </p>
  <p><strong>9.623</strong> UNALIGNED GOVERNORS: An unaligned Senator
in the Forum may be elected Governor, but this removes him from the
Forum and makes him immune to Persuasion Attempts until his return to
Rome when he is again placed in the Forum. An unaligned Governor
collects taxes for the state but does not engage in personal
plundering of his Province. </p>
  <p><strong>9.624</strong> VACANT PROVINCES: No income of any kind is
generated by a Province without a Governor. Therefore, a new Province
never creates Revenue during its first turn of existance because it
has no Governor during that Revenue Phase. However, a Field Consul
who revolts after collecting a Bequest may immediately assume the
priviliges of Governor and thereby collect all Personal and State
taxes of that Province (as well as Local taxes in the Advanced Game;
14.2) in addition to retaining those Legions of his command with
allegiance to him (<a href="#11.21">11.21</a>; <a href="#10.51">10.51</a>).
  </p>
  <p><strong>9.625</strong> FRONTIER PROVINCES: Those Provinces with
underscored names and black border silhouettes are Frontier Provinces
which are susceptible to Barbarian Raids and should be garrisoned (<a
 href="#9.641">9.641</a>) accordingly. </p>
  <p><strong>9.626</strong> PROHIBITIONS: The Senate may not vote to
alter the rules. For example, the Senate may not vote funds to run
Games on ensuing turns, or force a Senator to make a contribution, or
a Censor to prosecute someone. These are matters of individual
initiative which cannot be decided by majority vote. </p>
  <p><strong>9.63</strong> LAND BILLS: The Senate can improve the
Unrest Level by passing Land Bills. Three kinds are available; Type
I is a one-year, single payment measure, while Types II and III are
permanent measures requiring yearly payments of five and ten Talents
but lowering the Unrest Level only during the year of their passage.
A Land Bill proposal must name two consenting Senators as sponsor and
co-sponsor. If the Land Bill passes, the Unrest Level is lowered and
the Popularity of the sponsor and co-sponsor is raised as indicated on
the Land Bill Table. Place the appropriate Land Bill marker in the
applicable Display box of the State Treasury as a reminder of funds
owed by the State during the Revenue Phase. Regardless of the
outcome, any Senator who votes against a Land Bill lowers his
Popularity as indicated on the Land Bill Table. However, a Senator
who vetos a Land Bill with a Tribune is not so penalized. The Senate
may propose no more than one Land Bill of each Type each Game Turn.
The number of Land Bills which may be in effect at one time is limited
by the number of such markers available. </p>
  <p><strong>9.631</strong> REPEALS: The Senate may attempt to repeal
a Type II or III Land Bill. The Senator who volunteers to sponsor the
repeal of a Land Bill must have Popularity <font face="symbol">&sup3;</font>
the amount he will lose by sponsoring and
voting for the repeal. The sponsor lowers his Popularity as indicated
on the Land Bill Table and must vote for that repeal. If the repeal
passes, the Unrest Level is raised as indicated on the Land Bill
Table. Regardless of whether the repeal passes or not, Senators who
vote for the repeal lower their Popularity accordingly. Only one Land
Bill repeal may be attempted per turn. </p>
  <p><strong>9.632</strong> PAYMENT: Payment for Land Bills is made
during the Revenue Phase by subtracting the costs of any current Land
Bills from the State Treasury. Remove the Type I Land Bill marker
after payment is made. </p>
  <p><strong>9.633</strong> ASSASSINS: Whenever both the Sponsor and
Co-Sponsor of a Land Bill are from the same Faction, they risk
assassination. Anytime prior to the end of the vote on the Land Bill,
one Senator may attempt an Assassination of either the Sponsor or
Co-Sponsor by rolling on the Assassination Table. If caught, that
Senator is killed. However, there are no further consequences to his
Faction as would normally accrue due to a caught Assassin (<a
 href="#9.84">9.84</a>). Regardless of the outcome, the vote on the
Land Bill continues. </p>
  <p><strong>9.64</strong> MILITARY FORCES: The Senate may vote to
raise new forces. The maximum number of Legions/Fleets the Republic
may raise is 25 of each. The number to be raised must be specified in
the original proposal, but the use to which they will be put and the
Senator (who must be a Consul, Dictator, or Proconsul [or Governor in
command of a Garrison in the Advanced Game]) who will command them
need not be. Theater and commander may be the subject of subsequent
proposals. Forces raised and not subsequently assigned will become
active and remain in Italy (in the Active box). The Senate may not
send a force to fight a War unless it is supported by the number of
Fleets required by that War card. The State Treasury must immediately
pay ten Talents for each new unit raised. The Senate may also vote to
reassign or disband loyal units. <a name="9.641"></a></p>
  <p><a name="9.641"><strong>9.641</strong></a> GARRISONS: The Senate
may vote to send one or more Legions to a Province to augment its
defenses. Once sent, they remain there until recalled. Garrisons are
under command of the current Governor. Garrison Maintenance costs are
paid by the Senate. </p>
  <p><strong>9.642</strong> MINIMUM FORCE: The Senate may not send a
Senator to fight a War without his consent unless the combined
strength of his force (including his military rating) is <font
 face="symbol">&sup3;</font> that of the War and any applicable Leader.
If as a result of losses sustained in a previous turn, a Proconsul's
force falls beneath that of the opposing War, he has no such right of
refusal and must attack again the following turn unless he has no
Legions or insufficient Fleets in which case he is automatically
recalled. The Senate may not recall Legions from a Proconsul which
will reduce the strength of his force to less that that of his War and
any applicable Leaders without his consent. </p>
  <p><strong>9.65</strong> MILITARY COMMAND: When a measure to send a
force away passes, those units are placed on that War card and their
Commander is immediately absent from Rome. The Field Consul (if
alive) must be sent to prosecute a War/collect a Bequest before (or
simultaneously with) the Rome Consul can be sent. Passage of any
measure sending the HRAO to War ends the Senate Phase. Consequently,
a player wishing to enact some other proposal during that Senate Phase
may play a Tribune card before or during his turn to vote on sending
the HRAO away-not as a veto, but as a measure to suspend the vote
until after his proposal has been acted upon. <a name="9.66"></a></p>
  <p><a name="9.66"><strong>9.66</strong></a> RECALL: The Senate may
vote to recall any Commander who was not victorious during the
previous Combat Phase. He returns to Rome immediately and his forces
are placed in the Active box unless a replacement Commander is sent to
take his place as part of the Recall. </p>
  <p><strong>9.67</strong> CONSUL FOR LIFE: Anytime during the Senate
Phase following the Consular elections, a player may nominate any
Senator in Rome with an Influence <font face="symbol">&sup3;</font> 21
"Consul for Life". The nominee may already hold office. For this
vote, the nominee may add his Influence to his vote total. If the
measure passes, that player wins the game should the Republic survive
the current Game Turn (see <a href="#12.31">12.31</a>). Consul For
Life can be proposed only once per turn and cannot be vetoed.
Assassination attempts may take place during such a vote, but once
elected that Senator cannot be assassinated. </p>
  <p><strong>9.68</strong> MINOR MOTIONS: A player may make gratuitous
motions to enhance the atmosphere of the game or inform another player
of his desire or dislike for a certain course of action. Passage of a
minor motions has no impact other than signaling one's intentions to
other players. Defeat of a Minor Motions carries no loss of Influence
penalty (<a href="#9.34">9.34</a>) to the initiator of that motion.
Votes of censure or gratitude, reprimands, personally insulting
proposals and suchlike can all be appropriate and used to weigh the
chances of passage of more meaningful proposals. </p>
  <p><strong>9.69</strong> PROPOSAL ALTERATION: Defeated proposals may
not be introduced again in the same Senate Phase without significant
change. If, for example, a proposal to assign Fabius eight Legions
fails, a proposal to assign Fabius seven Legions or Claudius eight
Legions may be put forward. In contrast, Concessions and Consul For
Life proposals can only be voted upon once per year. <a name="9.7"></a></p>
  <p><a name="9.7"><strong>9.7</strong></a> TRIBUNES: Tribune cards may
be played during the Senate Phase to veto or initiate
proposals/nominations. Once used, they are discarded. </p>
  <p><strong>9.71</strong> INITIATOR: After the completion of any
Prosecutions, a Senator may use a Tribune card to compel the Presiding
Magistrate to place a proposal on the floor and bring it to a vote. </p>
  <p><strong>9.72</strong> VETO: A Tribune may be used prior to or
during the owning Faction's turn to vote to stop any vote from being
taken, whether it is an election, Prosecution, or other proposal
[EXCEPTIONS: Consul for Life, Prosecutions of Assassins, the proposals
of a Dictator, and the last eligible candidate for any office cannot
be vetoed]. The Senator playing the Tribune announces "Veto", and the
vote is cancelled-even if it already had sufficient affirmative votes
declared for passage. The slate of candidates in a vetoed election
may not be nominated again in the same year, nor may the accused in a
vetoed Prosecution be prosecuted again that year. Any vetoed proposal
may not be introduced again in that Senate Phase. </p>
  <p><strong>9.8</strong> ASSASSINS: Players may attempt to eliminate
opposing Senators by announcing an Assassination attempt. They may
add to their Assassination dr by playing one or more Assassin cards
prior to the resolution, but possession of an Assassin card is not
necessary to attempt an unaided Assassination. No Faction may be the
target of more than one attempt per turn, and no Faction may attempt
more than one Assassination per turn. </p>
  <p><strong>9.81</strong> SENATE IN SESSION: Assassinations may be
attempted only while the Senate is in session and only by and against
those in attendance. Once the Senate is adjourned, it is no longer
possible to attempt an Assassination during that Game Turn. The
timing of an Assassination attempt can be critical, so the players may
want to agree beforehand on a short phrase (e.g., "die swine") that
will mark the exact moment of the attempt. It will thus be easier to
decide if a sole Consul was killed before he could finish announcing
the appointment of one of his fellow Faction members as Dictator. </p>
  <p><strong>9.82</strong> RESOLUTION: The assassin announces the
Senator making the attempt, and his target before making the dr. A
result of "5", or more kills the target. A result of "3" or "4"
fails. A result of "2" or less results in the assassin being caught
and implicating his Faction Leader. </p>
  <p><strong>9.83</strong> BODYGUARDS: If the target Senator has one
or more "Secret Bodyguard" cards, he may announce after the dr how
many of those cards he will play to defend against the Assassination
attempt. Each Bodyguard so used subtracts "1" from the dr and is
discarded after use. The "Open Bodyguard" card must be in play prior
to an Assassination attempt to have any effect. If the assassin is
not caught, for each Bodyguard card played, the assassin must roll
again with all applicable modifiers solely to determine if he is
caught. It is therefore possible for the first dr to kill the victim,
and a subsequent dr to result in the assassin's capture. <a name="9.84"></a></p>
  <p><a name="9.84"><strong>9.84</strong></a> PUNISHMENT: A caught
assassin is killed. In addition, his Faction Leader loses five
Influence and is the subject of an immediate special Major Prosecution
with an automatic DR on the Popular Appeal Table. However, instead of
adding his own Popularity to the DR, the accused Faction Leader must
subtract the Popularity of the victim from the DR. In addition to his
own death, if the Faction Leader is found guilty, a number of
Mortality Chits equal to the victim's Popularity are drawn and any
other members of the assassin's Faction currently in Rome whose
Mortality Chit is drawn are also implicated and killed. Neither
Censor nor Prosecutor are involved in this Prosecution, although the
Censor chooses the voting order. </p>
  <p><strong>9.9</strong> DICTATOR: Prior to the Censor election the
Consuls may choose to appoint a Dictator only if Rome is currently
facing three or more Active Wars or one with a strength <font
 face="symbol">&sup3;</font> 20. If no Proconsuls exist from the
previous year, this is the only way the Republic can prosecute three
wars at once. </p>
  <p><strong>9.91</strong> APPOINTMENT: After the Consular elections
but before Prosecutions, the Consuls, acting together, may appoint any
Senator on whom they can agree and who is not already holding an
office, Dictator. If there is only one Consul present because the
other has been assassinated, he may act alone to appoint a Dictator.
If neither of these situations exist, a Dictator will be elected by
the Senate if the HRAO calls for such elections. The chosen Senator
takes the Dictator marker and a Prior Consul marker, increases his
Influence by seven, and appoints any Senator of his choice not already
holding an office his Master of Horse. That Senator takes the Master
of Horse marker and increases his Influence by three. </p>
  <p><strong>9.92</strong> TERM: The new Dictator becomes Presiding
Magistrate. His proposals cannot be vetoed. The term of the Dictator
(and his Master of Horse) lasts until the Senate Phase of the next
Game Turn, when he must hold the consular elections and surrender his
office (unless already in revolt), although he may be immediately
appointed/elected again. </p>
  <p><strong>9.93</strong> MASTER OF HORSE: Whenever the Dictator
commands an army/fleet he is accompanied by his Master of Horse. The
Dictator's Military rating for any combat is the sum of his Military
rating and that of his Master of Horse. The Master of Horse must
accompany the Dictator on any Campaigns and cannot act independently
of the Dictator, except to possibly remain loyal if the Dictator
revolts. If victorious in a war, the Dictator receives the usual
increase in his Influence/Popularity (<a href="#10.4">10.4</a>) and
the Master of Horse gets nothing. If the Dictator is defeated, the
Master of Horse is killed along with him. The Master of Horse can
also be killed by a Mortality Chit draw during a Battle result (<a
 href="#10.8">10.8</a>). The Master of Horse also adds to the
Commander's Military rating in a Naval battle (reflecting the greater
efficiency of a unified command), but cannot be used to nullify a
Disaster/Standoff result in any battle (<a href="#10.21">10.21</a>/<a
 href="#10.31">10.31</a>). </p>
  <p>NOTE: Each player should readjust his Vote Tally markers as soon
as he gains or loses votes due to recruitment of a Knight, Senator
gains or losses due to death, persuasion, or absence from Rome. <a
 name="COMBAT"><font color="#ee0000">
  <h3>10. COMBAT
PHASE</h3>
  </font></a></p>
  <p><strong>10.1</strong> WAR: Any Wars to which the Senate has sent
an army are now fought. Rome is always the attacker. The Senate need
not fight every War. However, any active War card which does not
contain at least one Legion (or a Fleet following a naval battle) at
the end of the Combat Phase, is moved to the Unprosecuted War section
of the Forum where it increases the Unrest Level (see <a href="#10.72">10.72</a>).
  <a name="10.11"></a></p>
  <p><a name="10.11"><strong>10.11</strong></a> LAND BATTLES: In land
combat the commanding Senator adds his Military rating to the Strength
of his army. Army Strength equals the number of Legions in the army;
Veteran Legions (see <a href="10.5">10.5</a>) count double. The
points added by the Commander's Military rating cannot be &gt; the
Strength of his army. From this sum he subtracts the Strength Number
of the War, which may be modified by the presence of a Matching War or
Leader (<a href="#7.34">7.34</a>). To this number is added a TDR, and
the resulting sum is located on the Combat Results Table to determine
the outcome. Lost Legions are always drawn at random from a cup from
among those present whenever there is a possibility of a Veteran,
Garrison, or rebel Legion being affected. </p>
  <p><strong>10.12</strong> NAVAL BATTLES: Those Wars with three
Strength Numbers require two separate battles; one naval and one land
combat. In each case the enemy fleets must be defeated before his
land forces may be attacked. Naval combat is the same as land combat
except that the number of Fleets rather than Legions is counted. Once
the enemy Fleets are defeated, his land forces may be attacked in the
same Combat Phase provided there are still sufficient Fleets in the
force to support the army. If the land combat is not won, the naval
battle need not be refought in subsequent turns. The war can be won
in subsequent turns by defeating only the enemy Land Strength.
Consequently, the Senate may decide to send no Legions to conduct such
a War, endeavoring to defeat the enemy naval force in one turn, and
his land forces in a subsequent turn. If the Senate attempts to win
both the naval and land battles in the same turn, it must send a
combined force of Fleets and Legions to defeat the naval force-which
could result in Legions taking losses during the naval battle. War
cards whose navies have been defeated are marked with a "Fleet
Victorious" marker. </p>
  <p><strong>10.2</strong> DEFEATS: A result of "Defeat" means the
Roman Commander is killed and his force loses the number of Legions
and Fleets (if it has them) indicated on the Combat Results Table.
Lost units are removed while surviving forces remain on the War card
until recalled or reinforced. The Unrest Level is increased by two. <a
 name="10.21"></a></p>
  <p><a name="10.21"><strong>10.21</strong></a> DISASTERS: Each
War/Leader card contains a Disaster number following a "D" in the
lower left-hand corner. If this number is rolled (prior to any
modification) while resolving combat, the Combat Results Table is
ignored and the battle is an automatic Disaster causing loss of half
(fractions rounded up) of all participating Roman forces. Fleet and
Legion losses are each halved and rounded up separately. The Roman
Commander is not necessarily killed, but Mortality Chits equal to the
number of Legions and Fleets actually lost in the Disaster must be
drawn to check for his death (<a href="#10.8">10.8</a>). The Unrest
Level is increased by one. </p>
  <p><strong>10.3</strong> STALEMATES: A result of "Stalemate" means
the war is undecided. The Roman force loses the number of Legions and
Fleets (if it has them) indicated on the Combat Results Table.
Surviving forces remain on the War card until the next Senate Phase
when they may be recalled or reinforced. The Roman Commander remains
in command as Proconsul unless Recalled (<a href="#9.66">9.66</a>) or
killed (<a href="#10.8">10.8</a>). There is no effect on the Strength
of the enemy [Exception: 14.411]. <a name="10.31"></a></p>
  <p><a name="10.31"><strong>10.31</strong></a> STANDOFFS: War/Leader
cards containing a number following a "S" in the lower right-hand
corner cause a Standoff if that number is rolled (prior to any
modification) while resolving combat. The Combat Results Table is
ignored. Losses in a Standoff equal one-fourth (fractions rounded up)
of all participating Roman forces. Some Wars have two Standoff numbers.
  <a name="10.4"></a></p>
  <p><a name="10.4"><strong>10.4</strong></a> VICTORY: A land "Victory"
lowers the Unrest Level by one and eliminates the War card. A naval
victory also lowers the Unrest Level but does not remove the War. The
Roman force loses the number of Legions and Fleets (if it has them)
indicated on the Combat Results Table and the surviving forces are
transferred to the Commander's card. In some cases one or more
Provinces will be created and placed in the Forum. The victorious
Senator increases both his Popularity and Influence by half (fractions
rounded up) of the unmodified (printed) Strength Number of the War
(even if the Victory was only a Naval battle and the War still
exists). The Banker also increases the State Treasury for Spoils of
War by an amount equal to that printed next to the Treasure Chest
symbol in the bottom-center of the card (except for Naval battles).
Revolts do not yield Spoils of War. </p>
  <p><font size="-1">EXAMPLE: Marius is dispatched with nine Legions to
deal with a Slave Revolt. Marius' Military rating of "4" is added to
the number of his Legions, for a total strength of 13. If Marius had
only three Legions, he could only add three from his Military rating.
The Strength Number on the Slave Revolt card is "6", which is
increased to "11" because the appropriate Leader card, Spartacus,
happens to be in play. "13" minus "11" is "2". The player
controlling Marius then makes a TDR, rolling a "10", which is added to
the base of "2" for a final result of "12". A "12" on the Combat
Results Table is a "Stalemate" with a loss of one Legion. Marius
loses one Legion (he has no Fleets), and must draw one Mortality Chit
to check for his own death. Had he had a Fleet to lose, he would have
had to draw two Mortality Chits. The Slave Revolt may be fought again
during the next Combat Phase. Had the Combat DR been "11" or "6", the
result would have been a Disaster with the loss of five Legions. Had
the Combat DR been a "16" or "14", the result would have been a
Standoff with the loss of three Legions.</font> <a name="10.5"></a></p>
  <p><a name="10.5"><strong>10.5</strong></a> VETERANS: One Legion from
among the survivers[sic] of a Stalemate, Standoff, or Victory is
transformed into a Veteran Legion by flipping it over to its Veteran
side. It will remain a Veteran Legion until eliminated or disbanded,
even if it is placed under the command of another Senator. The
corresponding Legion allegiance marker is placed on the Commander's
card until he dies or the Legion is eliminated. <a name="10.51"></a></p>
  <p><a name="10.51"><strong>10.51</strong></a> ALLEGIANCE: Veteran
Legions count double in combat regardless of which Senator owns their
allegiance. If a Senator revolts, the Veteran Legions in his army
require no maintenance. If the rebel Senator has Veteran Legions in
an opposing army, they desert to his side before combat. Likewise,
Veteran Legions of loyal Senators in the army of the rebel Senator
desert to the Senate before combat. All veteran Legions, regardless
of their location gravitate who owns their allegiance before the
resolution of any rebel battle vs the Senate. </p>
  <p><strong>10.52</strong> TAKING LOSSES: When elements of both
Veteran/Garrison Legions/Provincial Armies are involved, the units
eliminated must be drawn at random from among those present. As long
as only Legions are involved this can be done by drawing the affected
units from a cup at random. However, when Provincial Armies are
involved, losses must be determined by dice roll on the Random Loss
Chart printed on the back page because there are no Provincial Army
pieces to facilitate a draw. </p>
  <p>When using the Random Loss chart, two dice (a colored die and a
white die) must be rolled for each unit eliminated. The dice are not
added in the conventional way but are "read" as a two-digit number;
the colored die always being read first. Thus a colored "1" and white
"6" are read as "16"-not "7". </p>
  <p><font size="-1">The player determines both his total number of
units
and the minority component of his combined force. For example, if a
battle was fought with eight Provincial Armies and three Garrison
Legions, the "Total Force" would be "11", the "Minority Forces" would
be three. The player would cross-index "11" Total Forces with "3"
Minority Forces to determine that a dice roll <font face="symbol">&pound;</font>
"24" will result in the loss of a Legion
from the Minority Force. A dice roll &lt; "24" will cause the loss
of a Provincial Army. </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Now let's assume the player had to lose two units.
His first dice
roll was a "31"-eliminating a Provincial Army. His new force
composition for the second dice roll will be a Total Force of "10" and
a Military Force of "3". If his next Loss Selection dice roll is <font
 face="symbol">&pound;</font> "25" he will lose a Legion. Let's
further assume that a Legion was lost but because there is on Veteran
Legion among the three Garrisons, a random draw must be made from
among those three units (rather than just selecting one) to determine
if the Veteran was eliminated.</font> </p>
  <p><strong>10.6</strong> NAVAL LOSSES: If Fleet losses cause Roman
Fleet Strength War card to fall below the number required for the
support of the War, during the next Senate Phase the additional
required Fleets must be sent or the entire force will return to Italy
(for possible use elsewhere), leaving the war unprosecuted. Fleets
are not necessary to withdraw those Legions-only to support them. <a
 name="10.7"></a></p>
  <p><a name="10.7"><strong>10.7</strong></a> PROCONSUL: A Commander
surviving a non-Victorious battle becomes a Proconsul and remains in
command of the army and away from Rome through the next Combat Phase
unless recalled by the Senate during the next Senate Phase. A Senator
may remain Proconsul as long as he retains his command vs the original
War he was sent to fight. This is the only circumstance in which a
Senator other than the current Consuls or Dictator may command troops
[EXCEPTION: Governors in the Advanced Game; 14.4]. The Proconsul is
not a Consul. On the next turn, two Consuls are again elected. </p>
  <p><strong>10.71</strong> REINFORCEMENTS: The Senate may send
additional forces to a Proconsul during the Senate Phase. If he has
no Legions left or insufficient Fleets to prosecute the War, he must
either be reinforced or recalled. <a name="10.72"></a></p>
  <p><a name="10.72"><strong>10.72</strong></a> UNPROSECUTED WARS: It
is
not required that an ongoing War be fought again the next Game Turn.
The Senate may choose during the next Senate Phase to recall the Army
and leave the war unprosecuted. In such a case, the War card is moved
to the "unprosecuted War" section of the Forum and the Unrest Level is
increased by one at the start of every Population Phase until that War
is again prosecuted. Should a Commander be killed, the Senate must
send a replacement if they wish to prosecute the war. An army cannot
remain in the field without a Commander. </p>
  <p>A War which was fought and not won but, due to combat losses
sustained, failed to end the Combat Phase with a Roman Legion is an
Unprosecuted War since the enemy is unchecked by remaining Roman
forces [Exception: If a Naval battle was fought against that War
during that turn, a surviving Fleet will suffice to avoid the
Unprosecuted War penalty]. It is thus possible that a single War
could result in an increase of 4 to the Unrest Level if it caused
Drought conditions and the Romans were both defeated by it and did not
have a Legion remaining on it at the end of the Combat Phase. Fleet
Support is not required after the Combat Phase to avoid Unprosecuted
War status. <a name="10.8"></a></p>
  <p><a name="10.8"><strong>10.8</strong></a> COMMANDER DEATH: In any
battle result other than a Defeat, a number of Mortality Chits equal
to the number of lost units must be drawn to see if the Roman
Commander (and/or his Master of Horse) has been killed/captured.
Mortality chits drawn in battle have no effect unless that of the
Commander (or his Master of Horse, or a Rebel) is drawn. Senators not
present at the battle are unharmed. A Commander who loses his entire
force is not necessarily harmed as a result of losses taken. A
Dictator whose Master of Horse has been captured/killed may appoint
another only upon reappointment/re-election as Dictator for the
current year. </p>
  <p><strong>10.81</strong> BARBARIAN RAIDS: Governors of Provinces
overrun by Barbarian Raids (<a href="#7.352">7.352</a>) must draw a
number of Mortality chits equal to the colored dr of the Raid DR. </p>
  <p><strong>10.82</strong> CAPTURE: A Commander/Master of Horse whose
Mortality Chit is drawn as the last (but not the first) of any
mortality chits to be drawn in a battle is not killed. Instead, he is
captured and subject to ransom. A captive Senator may be returned to
Rome upon payment to the Bank by either his Factor or Personal
Treasury. The ransom amount is ten Talents or two Talents per
Influence of the captive (whichever is more). If the War is defeated
before the captive is ransomed he dies. Ransoms paid to Barbarian
Raids must be paid before the following Forum Phase to save the
captive. A Senator who captures an opposing Senator in a Civil War
always kills him. Captives are subject to normal Mortality chit and
Foreign Epidemic draws. Another Senator from the same Family cannot
replace a captive while he lives. </p>
  <p><strong>10.9</strong> MULTIPLE COMMANDERS: The Senate may send
more than one Army under different Commanders to fight the same War.
However, if they do so, each Army must attack separately-one at a time
until the War is defeated or all Armies have attacked. The advantage
of sending separate armies to fight a single War is that
Disaster/Standoff results do not apply to subsequent battles of the
same year vs that War if a previous battle that turn resulted in a
Stalemate/Standoff. <a name="REVOLUTION"><font color="#ee0000">
  <h3>11. REVOLUTION
PHASE</h3>
  </font></a><a name="11.1"></a></p>
  <p><a name="11.1"><strong>11.1</strong></a> EXCESS INTRIGUE CARDS:
Any
player with more than five red cards in his hand must discard, play,
or trade the excess cards of his choice so that he has no more than
five remaining. Any player with a red Statesman/concession card in
his hand who wishes to play it for the coming turn must do so at this
time. All such declarations start with the player controlling the
HRAO and then proceed clockwise. </p>
  <p><strong>11.2</strong> DECLARATION OF CIVIL WAR: Any victorious
Commander must either lay down his command and return his forces to
the Active Box or declare himself in revolt. [In the Advanced Game, a
Governor may also declare his revolt now. Otherwise, if his term
expires in the upcoming Revenue Phase he must return his Province card
to the Forum and return to Rome.] These declarations start with the
player controlling the HRAO and then proceed clockwise. Since the
Master of Horse does not have an independent command, he can be
declared in revolt only in conjunction with the Dictator, or if the
Dictator is dead. Only one Faction may be in revolt at a time.
Should a Faction which wishes to revolt field a stronger force
(inclusive of the respective Commanders' Military ratings) than that
of a previously declared rebel, the initial rebel's declaration is
ignored, and the player with the stronger force is considered in
revolt instead. Once a rebel has been determined, no other player may
revolt until that rebel has been defeated. <a name="11.21"></a></p>
  <p><a name="11.21"><strong>11.21</strong></a> COMMANDER ALLEGIANCE:
Before announcing his decision, a Commander considering revolt may
make a dr for each Legion in his current command to determine if it
will follow him. A dr <font face="symbol">&sup3;</font> 5 is required
for a Legion to follow the rebel Senator during the Early Republic.
This dr is lowered to "<font face="symbol">&sup3;</font> 4" in the Mid
Republic, and to "<font face="symbol">&sup3;</font> 3" in the Late
Republic. Before making these die rolls, he may irrevocably spend
money from his Personal Treasury (or the Personal Treasury of his
Master of Horse with his consent) to buy modifications to those die
rolls. For each Talent spent, the rebel Commander may add one to the
Loyalty dr of one Legion (maximum modification +1 per Legion).
Veteran Legions owing their allegiance to a Commander and
Garrisons/Provincial Forces of a Governor follow their Commander
automatically. </p>
  <p><strong>11.22</strong> SECONDARY REBELS: When a Senator revolts,
each of the other Senators in his Faction must immediately declare
their loyalty to the State or join him in revolt. Those who remain
loyal to the State may continue to function and collect income
normally. Those who join the revolt leave Rome and are therefore
immune to Persuasion Attempts but lose all Senatorial income (<a
 href="#11.4">11.4</a>) and share the fate of the rebel should he be
defeated. Any money in their Personal Treasuries can be used by the
rebel as if it were his own. Veteran Legions owing allegiance to the
rebel or secondary rebels will follow him in revolt without
maintenance. Secondary rebels with independent commands may not
contribute other forces to the rebel at this time and must return
their Legions/Fleets (not Provincial forces) to Senate control. </p>
  <p><strong>11.3</strong> MAINTENANCE: During the Revenue Phase the
rebel Senator must pay out of his Personal or Faction Treasury the
maintenance for all Legions under his command (<a href="#6.13">6.13</a>).
Veteran Legions owing allegiance to a rebel
Senator require no maintenance. Other Veteran Legions owing no
allegiance to a rebel Senator must be maintained normally. Those
Legions not remaining with the rebels return to the Senate's control.
Since it is assumed the rebel has already returned to Italy with his
army, Fleets play no role in a Civil War (unless the optional
Provincial Forces and Garrisons rules are being used; 14.7). <a
 name="11.4"></a></p>
  <p><a name="11.4"><strong>11.4</strong></a> INCOME: A Senator in
revolt must return his Concessions to the Forum and loses all Knights
and Aligned Senator income. His Personal Treasury is frozen; he may
not receive money directly from other loyal Senators in his Faction-or
may he contribute to his Faction Treasury or any loyal Senator's
Personal Treasury-although he may use his Faction Treasury to finance
the maintenance of his forces. Loyal Senators of his Faction may
still contribute money to their Faction Treasury. </p>
  <p><strong>11.5</strong> COMBAT: During the Combat Phase the rebel
Senator must fight the army dispatched by the Senate. If the Senate
fails to send an army against him, his coup is successful and he wins
the game (provided the Republic survives the Turn; <a href="#12.32">12.32</a>).
  </p>
  <p><strong>11.51</strong> ALLEGIANCE: If the rebel has any active
Veteran Legions, they immediately desert to him. If there are Veteran
Legions of a loyal Senator in the rebel army, the loyal Senator may
instruct his Legions to desert to the Senate's army. <a name="11.52"></a></p>
  <p><a name="11.52"><strong>11.52</strong></a> RESOLUTION: The Senate
is the attacker and the rebel the defender. The normal combat
procedure is followed (see <a href="#10.11">10.11</a>). The Strength
Number of the defender in this case being the sum of the Military
rating of the rebel Senator and the combined Strength of the Legions
in his army. Any losses except "ALL" called for by the Combat Results
table are applied equally to <em>both</em> armies. A result of
"Victory" means the revolt has failed, the rebel Senator is killed,
and all surviving rebel Legions are returned to the Active box. The
Commander of the Senate's Army increases both his Popularity and
Influence by an amount equal to half of the Strength of the Rebel Army
he has defeated. "Stalemate" means the Civil War is undecided, and
must be continued during the next Combat Phase. The number of
Mortality Chits drawn remain the same but can affect <em>either</em>
Commander. "Defeat" means the revolt has succeeded and the rebel now
rules Rome and wins the game, barring the collapse of the Republic (<a
 href="#12.32">12.32</a>). All surviving Senate armies are returned to
Rome and the rebel Army suffers no losses. A rebel also wins if the
State is bankrupt or overturned by a "People Revolt" result on the
Population Table (<a href="#8.2">8.2</a>). <a name="VICTORY"><font

  <p><strong>12.3</strong> SURVIVAL: Regardless of how a player wins,

4.4. Each player then draws the first three red cards from the gray
deck as per 4.7. The developed Province cards of Sicily, Illyricum,
Sardinia-Corsica, Nearer and Further Spain, and Cisalpine Gaul are
shuffled and randomly dealt one per player to be assigned to a Senator
in his Faction of his choice with any leftover being placed in the
Forum. The undeveloped Province cards of Narbonese Gaul,
Cilicia-Cyprus, Greece, Africa, and Asia are likewise distributed. [In
a six-player game, each player makes a TDR to determine the low roller
who will not receive a Governorship.] The amount of each Governor's
term (one to three years) is up to
that player to decide. All gray Law cards are placed in the Law space
and considered in play except for the Servilian and Acilian Laws which
negate each other. Eight Legions are active in Rome. Otherwise,
proceed as in the Early Republic scenario.<br>
  </p>
  <p><a name="12.6"><strong>12.6</strong></a> EXTENDED GAME: Rather
than ending play during the turn that the last card is drawn from the
Forum Deck, continue into the Mid (or Late) Republic by shuffling the
deck from that period and placing it in play. Play proceeds normally
after noting the increased Legion Loyalty numbers for Revolts (11.21)
and the new Random Events Table column in use for the new period. Such
a decision must be made prior to the start of play or by unanimous
agreement of all players.<br>
  </p>
  <p><a name="12.7"><strong>12.7</strong></a> ALTERNATE HISTORY
SCENARIO: Ignore the deck color coding and combine all cards in one
shuffled deck, but otherwise proceed with the normal Prepare for Play
(4) routine. The Random Events column and Legion Loyalty Numbers will
advance at the start of the 8th and 16 turns.:&nbsp; </p>

  <h3>13. PONTIFEX MAXIMUS</h3>
  </font></p>
  <p><strong>13.1</strong> ELECTION: During the Senate Phase of the
first Game Turn a Pontifex Maximus is elected immediately after the
two Consuls to look after Rome's religious affairs. The Senator
elected places the Pontifex Maximus marker on his card and increases
his Influence by five, but gains no further Influence in succeeding
years for holding the office. He holds this office for life or until
stripped of it by Senate vote, multiple Evil Omens, or Prosecution.
he may not resign it voluntarily. </p>
  <p><strong>13.2</strong> PRIESTHOODS: During the Senate Phase of
each Game Turn, including the first, the Pontifex Maximus must assign
or reassign a Priesthood to any one Senator present unless there are
none left without one. </p>
  <p><strong>13.21</strong> INFLUENCE: The announcement of the new
Priesthood may be made at any time during the Senate Phase, and the
nominee immediately places a Priesthood marker on his card and
increases his Influence by one. A Senator may hold only one
Priesthood, but this does not bar him from holding any other office.
When a Priesthood is reassigned, the Senator who loses the office must
decrease his Influence by one (to a minimum of 0). </p>
  <p><strong>13.22</strong> PRIEST BATTLE INFLUENCE: Every Priest
receives one extra vote when voting on a proposal that will send
forces into battle or change/retain their Commander. </p>
  <p><strong>13.3</strong> PONTIFEX MAXIMUS BATTLE INFLUENCE: The
Pontifex Maximus doubles his personal votes (including those of his
Knights but not his bribes) when voting on any proposal that will send
forces to War or change/retain their Commander. </p>
  <p><strong>13.4</strong> VETO: The Pontifex Maximus may use a veto
once each Senate Phase without use of a Tribune card during or prior
to his Faction's turn to vote. </p>
  <p><strong>13.5</strong> COLLECTIONS: During the Revenue Phase the
Pontifex Maximus receives income from temple collections equal to a
dr. </p>
  <p><strong>13.6</strong> EVIL OMENS: When Evil Omens occur, the
Pontifex Maximus must pay the 20 Talent cost from his Personal
Treasury. If he can't pay the 20 Talents, or if a second Evil Omens
occurs in the same turn, he is immediately stripped of his office and
loses five Influence. If he is unable to pay the full Evil Omens
cost, the difference plus a ten Talent fine is levied on his Faction
Treasury. If the Faction Treasury has insufficient funds, what money
there is in that Treasury is lost, and the Faction Leader may also be
the subject of a Major Prosecution during the following Senate Phase
in addition to any regular Prosecutions the Censor may wish to
conduct. The State must pay any shortfall in the Evil Omens cost
(excluding the Faction fine) not paid by the Pontifex Maximus or his
Faction. </p>
  <p><strong>13.7</strong> RECALL: The Pontifex Maximus may be
deprived of his office during any Senate Phase by a <em>two-thirds</em>
majority vote of those present. He may not veto
that proposal, although another Senator (of his or another Faction)
wielding a Tribune may. If voted out of office, he loses five
Influence. Regardless of the cause of a Pontifex Maximus' removal,
the Priesthoods he has assigned are not affected. </p>
  <p><strong>13.8</strong> SUCCESSOR: If the Pontifex Maximus is
removed from office, a new one must be elected immediately after the
Consular elections during the following Senate Phase. <font
 color="#ee0000">
  <h3>15. LEGIONARY DISBANDMENT &amp;
RECALL</h3>
  </font></p>
  <p><strong>15.1</strong> DISBANDMENT: During the Revolution Phase, a
loyal Commander may disband any of his Veteran Legions loyal to him
that are currently under his command. The identities of the disbanded
Legions are noted by retaining their Legion Allegiance markers on his
card and flipping them to their Disbanded side. The Legions are
removed from play. For each Legions disbanded, the Senator increases
both his Oratory and Influence by one. </p>
  <p><strong>15.2</strong> RECALL: A Senator who has disbanded Veteran
Legions may recall those Legions to active status <em>whenever he is
Consul</em> by paying from his Personal or Faction Treasury ten
Talents per Legion during the Senate Phase. For each Legion he
recalls, the Senator flips their Allegiance marker on his card and
decreases both his Oratory and Influence ratings by one. Recalled
Legions regain their Veteran status and must be maintained by the
Senate at the normal rate. Recalled Legions may be assigned by the
recalling Senator to either his own army or the army of any other
Senator and will fight at double strength. If a disbanded Legion is
raised again by the Senate, it can no longer be recalled and no longer
has Veteran status. However, the Senate may not recall a Veteran
Legion if a non-Veteran Legion remains to be built. </p>
