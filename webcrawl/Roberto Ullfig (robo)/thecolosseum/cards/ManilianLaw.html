<h2>Manilian Law : 66 BC</h2>
Hereafter, any Victorious Commander may make War without Senate
approval by keeping his Army and moving it to a current War card during
the Revolution Phase (provided he has the necessary Fleets). He is not
considered in revolt; he is considered a Proconsul.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 204);">[Civil War Deck: This card
must be
played in the Senate Phase during the Civil War Deck. If the card had
previously been discarded it is brought back into play.]</span><br>
