<h2>Annexation of Egypt. - 30 BC<br>
</h2>
Playable during the Senate Phase to force the Senate to vote for the
creation of <a
 href="Egypt.html">Egypt</a>
as a province. The vote must occur after all other
provinces have been assigned. This vote cannot be vetoed and can only
occur once in the game. Cannot be played if the Alexandrine War has not
yet been discarded. If the vote passes a governor must be elected to
Egypt before any other proposals can be made. The faction playing this
card must have a senator in Rome when this card is played.<br>
