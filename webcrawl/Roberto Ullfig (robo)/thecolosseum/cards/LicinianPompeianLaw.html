<h2>Licinian-Pompeian Law : 55 BC</h2>
Playable only if the Vatinian Law is already in play. Allows more
flexibility in the use of provincial forces; any commander who is also
a governor (by the Vatinian Law) may add any provincial forces from a
province he is governing to his command at any time before the combat
TDR if the province is listed on the war he is attacking (not
necessarily the first province). As long as he remains a commander, the
provincial forces may remain part of his forces (even if he attacks a
different war that no longer lists the original province) - these
forces still count towards the province's maximum force. When he is no
longer a commander, the provincial forces are returned to the province.
Provincial forces are always loyal to their commander, and may not be
recalled or disbanded by the Senate.<br>
