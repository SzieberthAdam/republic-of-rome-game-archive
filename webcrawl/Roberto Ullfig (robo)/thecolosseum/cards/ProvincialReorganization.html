<h2>Provincial Reorganization<br>
</h2>
Combine each of Nearer &amp; Further Spain, Transalpine &amp; Narbonese
Gaul, Cisalpine Gaul &amp; Sardinia- Corsica, and Syria &amp;
Cilicia-Cyprus into one province each (for a total of 4 larger
provinces). Each one of these provinces must be governed by a prior
consul if one is available, otherwise elect anyone to a one-year term.
Each of the provinces has the combined value of each of it's smaller
provinces, and the combined province should be notated by stacking the
smaller provinces. Anything that would effect one of the provinces
(Pretender, Barbarians, etc.) effects the one new province similarly.
If either province is unimproved, the new province is treated as
unimproved (although are improved/sacked together afterwards). All
governors in affected provinces are immediately recalled when this law
is played. Once this law is played, the Vatinian Law may not be played;
Likewise, if the Vatinian Law is in play, this law may not be played.<br>
