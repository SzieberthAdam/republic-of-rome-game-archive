<h1>Birth of the Republic 509-264 BC</h1>
<h3>Version 2.0 - 8/14/07<br>
</h3>
<h4>By Roberto A. Ullfig</h4>
<h4>Covering the period from the expulsion of the last Roman king,
Tarquinius Superbus, and the establishment of the Republic to
the 1st Punic War. </h4>
Note: These rules are written with a 6-player game in mind. Rules for
fewer
players are given towards the end.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Changes in new version: Basically
a few more cards were added to each deck. 2 new wars, 2 new events and
4 new intrigue cards.</span><br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Two new periods (each with a new deck) are played before the Early
Republic
period. The game begins with the Latin period and deck (19 cards)
followed
by the Italian period and deck (19 cards) before finally entering the
Early
Republic from the original game. The 1st Punic War is not necessarily
the
first war in the Early Republic as it is shuffled into that deck. On
average, 8 new turns are played before the Early Republic begins.
Several
rules
are inactive at the start and only come into being as play proceeds.
<h2>Latin Period 509-390 BC </h2>
<h3>Setup</h3>
Rome begins with 30t and 2 Legions; 1 Active War, and 1
Leader begin in play:<br>
<br>
<table border="2" bordercolor="black" cellpadding="5" width="500">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>1st Latin War</b> 499-493<br>
      <i>Active War</i><br>

Victory allows Tax Farmers 1 &amp; 2 to be played.<br>
Strength x 2: 2 related Wars<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Tarquinius Superbus</b> ?-495<br>
      <i>Leader</i><br>
+1 to 1st Latin War; D7/S14<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span><br>
      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pontifex Maximus cannot be
elected until this Leader is discarded.<br>
      </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Eliminated when 1st
Latin War is defeated</span><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h3>Annual Revenue</h3>
Annual Revenue at start is 30t. (-10t on turn 1 due to active
War). The State should therefore have a total of 46 talents after
collecting annual revenue and paying maintenance for 2 legions on
turn 1.<br>
<br>
The State's Annual Revenue is increased by victory over
certain wars as noted on the war card's description and listed
here:<br>
<br>
<b>Siege of Veii</b> : +10t<br>
<b>2nd Latin War</b> : +10t<br>
<b>1st Samnite War</b> : +10t<br>
<b>2nd Samnite War</b> : +20t<br>
<b>3rd Samnite War</b> : +20t<br>
<br>
Defeat of all five of these wars would therefore make the
annual revenue equal to 100t, as in the normal game.
<h3>Legion Pool</h3>
Rome begins with 2 active legions and 5 legions in the Pool
so it can only muster a maximum of 7 legions at the start. Rome
cannot build any fleets until the Early Republic at which time it
can build as many fleets as it can build legions.
The State's Legion Pool is increased by victory over
certain wars as noted on the war card's description and listed
here:<br>
<br>
<b>Siege of Veii</b> : +3 legions<br>
<b>2nd Latin War</b> : +3 legions<br>
<b>1st Samnite War</b> : +2 legions<br>
<b>2nd Samnite War</b> : +5 legions<br>
<b>3rd Samnite War</b> : +5 legions<br>
<br>
Defeat of all five of these wars would therefore make the
Legion Pool equal to 25, as in the normal game.
Note that only the Pool is increased in size - the legions
must still be paid for in order to be used.
<h3>HRAO</h3>
There is no Consul at the start. The HRAO is determined via
normal rules using the senator with highest influence (oratory in
case of ties).
<h3>Senators</h3>
1. Shuffle senators #1 through #16, #18,&nbsp; #24 (from the Middle
Republic Deck) and deal 3 to each player.<br>
2. Senators&nbsp; #19 and #20 will be shuffled into the Early Republic
Deck.<br>
3. Senator #17 will be shuffled into the Middle Republic Deck.<br>
3. Rename Senator #12 Acilius to #12 Atilius.<br>
4. Reletter Statesman #18A Flamininus to #18B.<br>
<h3>Brutus</h3>
The player who receives #10 Junius is given this Statesman
which he must play during Initial Intrigue:<br>

2. <b>Evil Omens</b>, <b>Natural Disaster</b>, and <b>Allied
Enthusiasm</b>
monetary effects are halved during the Pre-Early Republic Period. The
Pontifex Maximus' fine from <b>Evil Omens</b> is only 5t (if he
can't pay the 10t for the Omens).<br>
<br>
3. <b>New Alliance</b> events are treated as
<b>Another New Alliance</b> for all wars from the Pre-Early
Republic Period (i.e. War is discarded with all spoils). For example, a
<b>New Alliance</b>
rolled
during the Early Republic can be treated as <b>Another New Alliance</b>
when
applied to a Pre-Early Republic War.<br>
<br>
4. Note that a Period is immediately entered when a card from that deck
is drawn.<br>
<h3>IV. Population Phase</h3>
No changes.
<h3>V. Senate Phase</h3>
1. A Censor cannot be elected (nor Prosecutions made) until
the turn after <b>The Twelve Tables</b> event (Latin Deck) is drawn.
Note that prior consul markers are always awarded for office
per normal rules (even before <b>The Twelve Tables</b> event occurs).
<br>
<br>
2. Land Bills cannot be proposed until after the <b>Agrarian Unrest</b>
event (Latin Deck) is drawn.
<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. Tribunes (including a
Statesman's free tribune)

<br>
4. Rome can build a maximum of 7 legions at the start; defeat
of certain wars adds more legions to the Pool. Rome cannot build
fleets until the Early Republic and the maximum number is the
same as for legions.
<br>
<br>
5. <b>Consular Tribunes (CT):</b>
CTs are elected instead of Consuls on the turn that
<b>The Twelve Tables</b> event is drawn.
A senator elected as CT gains 2 Influence, regardless of the
Period, and a Prior Consul marker. Any and all CT's can be
sent to war. The Presiding Magistrate is the CT with the most
influence (oratory breaks ties). Note that The Senate Phase
ends when the PM leaves Rome. A Dictator appointment requires
all three to agree. A CT cannot be elected Consul next turn;
otherwise, treat a CT just like a Consul.
<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">6. A Pontifex Maximus cannot be
elected until after </span><span

*: applies to Popularity as well.<br>
All other influence/popularity gains/losses remain as in the Early
Republic<br>
<h3>VI. Combat Phase</h3>
1. Veteran legions are not created until the Early Republic.<br>
<br>
2. Legions and Military Rating: remember that Military Rating in excess
of
the number of legions in an army is unused. Example: 2 legions and a
commander with Military Rating of 5 has an army strength of only 4. <br>
<h3>VII. Revolution Phase</h3>
1. Commanders cannot become Proconsul until the Early
Republic. They always return to Rome with their army during the
Revolution Phase
(even if not victorious) and cannot rebel. The return of the army in
this case
would not negate the prosecution status of the war.
Clarification: If a war would normally be considered
prosecuted, it is still considered prosecuted after the army returns.<br>
<br>
2. The <b>Tax Farmer</b> concessions cannot be played until certain
wars are defeated:<br>
<br>
<b>Tax Farmer</b> 1 and 2 - <b>1st Latin War</b><br>
<b>Tax Farmer</b> 3 and 4 - <b>Volscian War</b><br>
<b>Tax Farmer</b> 5 and 6 - <b>Aequian War</b><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. A Latin Period Statesman&nbsp;
is discarded if he is in play at the start of the first Revolution
Phase of
the Early Republic; ALL his possessions EXCEPT for his office are
transferred to the family card. He cannot be prosecuted next turn for
the office and he is eligible for Consul regardless of what office he
had
held. Possessions
refers to all chits, Influence, Popularity, Prior Consul, etc. on the
Senator. A Latin Period Statesman must be discarded if still in a

<br>
</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">4. The family card of a Latin
Period Statesman is
always placed beneath the statesman if it is ever found to be in the
Curia or
Forum. This is so that the player
can transfer the Statesman's possessions to the family card during the
first Revolution Phase of the Early Republic.</span><br>
<br>
5. Early Republic Statesmen cannot be played unless there are less than
6 cards remaining in the Italian Deck.<br>
<h3>VIII. Other</h3>
1. The Games, Population, Combat Results, Land Bill, and Popular Appeal
table remain the same as in the Early Republic.<br>
2. Intrigue cards from the Latin, Italian, and Early Republic decks
should not be distinguishable from each other. They should all look the
same and have the same color background.<br>
<h3>HRAO Tie Breaker</h3>
In addition to rule 9.1 from the rulebook, if there still a tie for
HRAO, i.e.
more than one senator with highest influence and equal oratory, then
the
final tiebreaker is lowest Senator ID number.

<h3>Military Statesman Void Disasters Optional Rule<br>
</h3>
When playing with optional rule 12, the Statesman affected are Brutus,
Camillus, and Cincinnatus.<br>
<br>
<h2>Optional Rules</h2>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. Consul for Life (King)<br>
</h3>
During the Latin and Italian periods the influence requirement for
Consul for Life is reduced from 21 to 16.<br>
<h2>Strategy Tips </h2>
<h4>Latin Period </h4>
Wars - There are only four wars including one active at the
start. They should be relatively easy to defeat unless combat
rolls are low or the Statesman that void their D/S numbers aren't
available. However, with only 7 legions at the start their
prosecution could be difficult. It is important to remember that
the military rating of a commander added to the legion strength
cannot exceed it, so with only 2 legions the maximum force you
can get is 4 regardless of the commander's rating. Going after
the Veientine War as early as possible is a good idea because it
adds 3 more legions to the Pool. The biggest decision with
regards to Wars is whether to attack two of them simultaneously
or concentrate on one of them, when there are more than one.
Dictator prerequisites are the same and since none of these wars
can have a strength &gt;= 20, three active wars are required; a
Dictator should be rare.<br>
<br>
Funds - This is a major challenge. The Sack of Rome costs the
State 30t, and combined with an Evil Omens or Natural Disaster,
the loss could be 40t or 55t. Since Rome needs to build as many
legions as possible early on, the State needs all the funds it
can muster. Until the Gallic Invasion is drawn, all players
should seriously consider contributing as much as they can. With
only 15 cards in deck there's 1 in 3 chance of the card being
drawn on turn 1. Note that the lucrative concessions don't enter
the game until the Early Republic so money will be severely
strained in the early going.<br>
<br>
Unrest - The second major challenge. There are _four_ cards
that increase the unrest. Since players will need to contribute,
there'll be little money left for games and Land Bills can't be
proposed until the Agrarian Unrest card is drawn. The Type I Land
Bill proposal required by that card can be a two-edged sword
since 20t is a a big hit on the Treasury early in the game. A
good source for popularity is fighting wars, but since the Field
Consul goes to war first, it could be difficult to send the Rome
Consul to a war. This is one good reason for attacking two wars
in one turn. Appius and Brutus are of course good canditates for
Rome Consul.<br>
<br>
<h4>Italian Period </h4>
Wars - One more war than the previous deck and two of them
(2nd Samnite War and Pyrrhic War) have considerable D/S
percentages. Making conservative attacks against them could
easily lead to some of these Wars remaining active into the Early
Republic, a situation which might not be avoidable anyway.<br>
<br>
Funds - The Treasury situation improves as long as the Wars
are defeated.<br>
<br>
Unrest - Not as big of a problem as the previous deck since
there is only one card that increases the unrest and Appian Way
is a cheap way to lower the unrest. As long as the Plebian Revolt
is dealt with, the Unrest will not be a problem unless it was
already high entering this period.<br>
<br>
<h4>Early Republic (as compared to the Early Republic scenario) </h4>
The State Treasury will probably be much less at the start of
the Early Republic (less than 100 compared to nearly 200);
however Rome should have a stronger army of Legions though no
Veterans. There is a problem with this situation though and that
is that the 1st Punic requires lots of fleets to attack and the
Senate will not have the money to build many. Note that Rome
won't have any fleets when it enters the Early Republic. If the
1st Punic War is drawn early on, Rome may not be able to attack
it. The only way to possibly prevent this situation is for major
contributions from the factions on the turn the Early Republic
begins.<br>
<br>
Since the 1st Punic War is shuffled in the deck, it's now
possible for Hamilcar or Hannibal to die before a Punic War is
drawn, so the war situation is slightly better in a way; however,
since one or more wars from the previous deck could still be in
play this tends to balance the difficulty. Also, since Flamininus
could start with more influence than normal (because of
Cincinnatus), the Macedonian situation is a bit trickier.<br>
<h2>Design</h2>
The intent of this scenario is to act as a setup for the main
course, The Early Republic. I thought that 6 turns would be
sufficient so 250 years are greatly compressed. Also, the
Senate probably did not function like it does in the normal
game so liberties are taken with history.
<p>There are historical inaccuracies in this scenario since
250 years are compressed into a mere 6 decks. Brutus
is generally accepted as being the first Consul and was
instrumental in the expulsion of the King but he did not
partake in the "1st Latin War" (which was more like a
revolt). That general was A. Postumius Albus who won
the war at Lake Regillus. Likewise, Tarquinius
Superbus probably had nothing to do with this war. I've
just condensed all these events into one. I didn't
add Albus since he has no family card and I
thought Brutus should be in, being the first Consul.
</p>
<p>The Twelve Tables were Laws that were written up
over the course of two years by the Decemvirs (10 men).
There were no Consuls during those two years - the
Decemvirs taking their place. It is not clear whether
the intent was for the Decemvirs to be a permanent
institution but a revolt overthrew the second Decemvir.
Consular Tribunes are probably unrelated directly to the
Decemvirs. I'm trying to represent the political chaos
here by using them.
</p>
<p>The Latin Period statesman are retired because I didn't
want them to hang around for more than 250 years!
Just discarding them would be no good since then a
player would have little incentive to build them up.
I didn't want the Early Republic swamped with Statesman.<br>
