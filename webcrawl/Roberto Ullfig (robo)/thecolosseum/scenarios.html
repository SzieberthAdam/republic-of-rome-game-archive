<pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">*** Scenario III. Gracchus to Sulla (6-player game)</span><br>    Start with 6 legions.<br>    Provinces of Sicily, Sardinia-Corsica, Illyricum, Cisalpine Gaul,<br>        Nearer Spain, Further Spain start the game undeveloped.<br>    Deal one province to each player at the start.<br>    Land Commissioner concession begins play in the Forum.<br>    Each player begins with 4 senators and 4 red cards.<br><br>--- Initial Deal<br>Senators #1-#24 (4/player)<br>Red Cards 24 total (4/player)<br><br>--- Initial Red Card Set (33 Total)<br>12 Concessions (Land Commissioner begins play in Forum)<br>Acilian Law<br>Calpurnian Law<br>Blackmail<br>Seduction<br>8 Tribune<br>2 Murder of a Tribune<br>Graft<br>Mob Incited to Violence<br>2 Assassin<br>2 Secret Bodyguard<br>Influence Peddling<br><br>Shuffle out 20 cards from this set together with these 4 Statesman:<br><br>  #1B  Scipio<br>  #7A  Flaccus<br>  #23A Laenas<br>  #25A T. Gracchus<br><br>and deal out 4 red cards to each player at start. The remaining 13 cards<br>are added to Deck 1 below. Note that this means that these 4 Statesman<br>will begin the game in a player's hand.<br><br>--- Deck 1 (26 Cards)<br>#25  Sempronius<br>#1C  Sulla<br>#21A Glaucia<br>#25B G. Gracchus<br>#27A Marius<br>13 other Red Cards (remainder from the Initial Red Card Set above)<br>3rd Macedonian War<br>4th Macedonian War<br>Spanish Revolt<br>3rd Punic War<br>Numantine War<br>1st Sicilian Slave Revolt<br>Viriathus<br>Pergamene Bequest<br><br>--- Deck 2 (26 Cards)<br>#26 Octavius<br>Servilian Law<br>Tradition Erodes<br>Military Reforms<br>Julian Law<br>Plautian-Papirian Law<br>Proscription<br>5 Tribune<br>Murder of a Tribune<br>Graft<br>Assassin<br>Secret Bodyguard<br>Influence Peddling<br>Jugurthine War<br>Germanic Migrations<br>1st Cilician Pirates<br>2nd Sicilian Slave Revolt<br>Social War<br>1st Mithridatic War<br>2nd Mithridatic War<br>Mithridates VI<br>Ptolemy Apion Bequest<br><br>Special Rules:<br>1. Use Middle Republic tables for Legion Loyalty/Random Events in Deck 1<br>2. Use Late Republic tables for Legion Loyalty/Random Events in Deck 2<br>3. The 4 Statesman (#1C, #21A, #25B, #27A) that begin the game in Deck 1<br>   cannot be played prior to Turn 5's Revolution Phase.<br>4. Sulla and Scipio may coexist. Sulla and Scipio are considered to have<br>   a Loyalty of 0 when they are in the same faction. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Historically,</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">   consider the Scipio card to represent Cinna - Sulla's enemy.</span><br>5. Land Commissioner begins in play in the Forum. The Land Commissioner<br>   cannot be assigned or claimed unless there is a Land Bill currently<br>   in play. #23A may claim the concession (as the card states) if he is<br>   in Rome as soon as a Land Bill is passed.<br>6. In PBEM play, cards from Deck 1 and Deck 2 are not distinguishable. A<br>   Tribune card drawn from Deck 1 looks exactly like a Tribune card drawn<br>   from Deck 2, for example.<br>7. Spanish Revolt and Numantine War do not match. Viriathus only matches<br>   the Spanish Revolt.<br>8. &lt;deleted&gt;<br>9. Each player can hold up to six cards (instead of five) during the<br>   Revolution Phase.<br>10.Clarification: The special abilities of statesman #23A, #25A, #25B<br>   are not considered Tribunes so cannot be cancelled by Murder of a<br>   Tribune or Graft.<br>11.Note that statesman #25A and #25B have loyalty of 0 when on _opposing_<br>   factions, not the same faction. They prefer to be in the same faction.<br>12.The Temporary Rome Consul is randomly determined.<br>13.Use Optional Rule 12. Military Statesmen Void Disasters. This affects<br>   Marius, Sulla, and Scipio.<br><br>Notes: Scipio actually was the victor against the Numantine War; The<br>Spanish Revolt was ended when Viriathus was murdered. The D/S percentage<br>for the Spanish Revolt + Viriathus is over 36% so it's best to allow<br>Scipio to void it. The Spanish Wars (including Sertorian Revolt) should<br>not match; they should not be comparable to the Mithridatic Wars in<br>strength. Also, when playing with the Delayed Matching War Rule, not<br>having them match means they'll become active quicker. Viriathus could be<br>made to match the Numantine War but then again you'd have a D/S<br>percentage of over 36% and allowing Scipio to void this war's D/S numbers<br>as well would make Scipio too strong.<br>   Allowing Sulla to be played while Cornelius (or Scipio) is controlled<br>by another player follows from the fact that Lucius Cornelius Cinna was<br>a rival to Sulla. I view Sulla as sort of a rogue branch of the Cornelii.<br>No need to add a Statesman to represent Cinna, the Cornelius family card<br>by itself can represent him.<br>  Note that whoever is dealt #25 T. Gracchus at the start can play him<br>since the family card does not begin in play.<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For a 5 player game do the following:</span><br>1. 4 of the initial senators begin the game in the forum.<br>2. 1 of the initial provinces begins the game assigned to an unaligned senator (first term).<br>3. Harbor Fees, Mining, Sicilian Grain, and Egyptian Grain start the game in the Forum.<br></pre>
