&nbsp;Complete Official Republic of Rome Q&amp;A

&nbsp;Includes all Q&amp;A on the sheet stamped 1/29/93, and all official answers
&nbsp;I have received. I am preparing another batch to send of the AH, so if you
&nbsp;have questions that aren't answered here, please e-mail me.

&nbsp;I apologize for any typeos, etc. These were hand copied from the original
&nbsp;sheet, so I probably made some minor mistakes. Let me know and I'll correct
&nbsp;them for future editions.

&nbsp;If there is enough interest in maintaining a RoR FAQ, I could be convinced
&nbsp;to manage it. Let me know what kind of FAQ's should be on it and send me
&nbsp;your answers :-)

&nbsp;(CAVEAT: I have truncated or clarified some of the Q&amp;A, and eliminated
&nbsp;some of the excessively stupid ones and one where the answer given was in
&nbsp;flagrant violation of the rules. However, I did keep in anything else on the
&nbsp;sheet, even where it made little sense. I especially dislike the answers
&nbsp;for persuasion and assassinations involving the FL. I heartily reccomend
&nbsp;you make your own house rules where the Q&amp;A came back odd. I strongly
&nbsp;believe that the answerer was not someone familiar with the game and
&nbsp;just tried to answer right out of the rulebook - and many of the
&nbsp;questions I sent in were sent in because the rules seemed to make no
&nbsp;sense. As many of you will no doubt appreciate, I have avoided
&nbsp;editorializing except for this paragraph :-)

&nbsp;3.III Is there only one round of bidding for each additional initiative?
&nbsp;A: Yes.

&nbsp;3.III.4: Can a player appoint a Faction Leader and sponsor Games in the
&nbsp;same initiative?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;5.1 Clarification: Mortality chits are not returned to the cup until
&nbsp;after the draw is complete, except for the draw 2 chits, which are
&nbsp;returned immediately. All chits are returned after the draw is complete.

&nbsp;5.3 &amp; 9.84: Upon the death of a faction leader, can the player
&nbsp;immediately appoint a new one, or must he wait until the next forum
&nbsp;phase?
&nbsp;A: The latter.

&nbsp;5.3: In the rare case that a faction is eliminated entirely, what
&nbsp;happens to its cards "in hand"?
&nbsp;A: Return them to the deck and reshuffle.

&nbsp;6.1: Does a captive senator receive personal or concession income?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;6.1: Personal Revenue: According to the sequence of play, Contributions
&nbsp;to the state are made before money can be redistributed. So why does the
&nbsp;book claim that "game consequences are such that it makes no difference
&nbsp;to which Senator(s) of a Faction the money is given at this point"?
&nbsp;A: 6.3 refers to Distributions between factions.&nbsp; Money can actually be
&nbsp;given to any Senator of your own faction in 6.1.

&nbsp;6.12: After the Calpurnian Law is played, are the talents collected from
&nbsp;the fine paid to the State treasury?
&nbsp;A: No. They are returned to the bank.

&nbsp;6.14: Do Rebel Governors roll for province improvement?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;6.141: Bithynia-Pontus: Can Bithynia be improved in the normal way? Does
&nbsp;Bithynia-Pontus turn back to its undeveloped side if it is overrun by
&nbsp;barbarians, or conquered by a war card and reconquered by Rome?
&nbsp;A: Yes. Yes.

&nbsp;6.22: Do wars such as the Jugurthine war, which do not indicate the
&nbsp;subtraction of 20T, still cost the State 20T in the Revenue phase.
&nbsp;A: Yes.

&nbsp;6.22 &amp; 9.674: Can a Senator not in Rome still be prosecuted?
&nbsp;A: No. In general, a Senator away from can Rome cannot do anything in
&nbsp;Rome except make contributions and sponsor games.

&nbsp;6.3: Is Faction income distributed simultaneously? Can a Senator absent
&nbsp;from Rome take part in the distribution? Are previously allocated funds
&nbsp;available for re-allocation?
&nbsp;A: Yes. Yes. Yes.

&nbsp;7.31: Does a Statesman take over any Prior Consul marker on his Family
&nbsp;card?
&nbsp;A: Yes.

&nbsp;7.312: Does P. Cornelius Scipio negate Hannibal's standoff/disaster
&nbsp;numbers, or just those associated with the Punic War cards?
&nbsp;A: Only those of the Punic War cards - not those of enemy leaders.

&nbsp;7.32: Concessions: May a senator opt not to take income on a concession?
&nbsp;A: No, but once received he could pledge to donate it to a worthy cause.

&nbsp;7.33: Is a war (if not inactive) considered Unprosecuted immediately
&nbsp;when drawn, or does it wait until that turn's Combat Phase is over
&nbsp;before (possibly) becoming Unprosecuted?
&nbsp;A: The latter.

&nbsp;7.331: ERRATA: Add Fleet after Army in the third line.

&nbsp;7.332 defines matching wars as those with matching illustrations, but
&nbsp;some such wars do not say anything about having any matching wars. Does
&nbsp;the Alexandrine War match the Syrian War?
&nbsp;A: No - delete "those with matching illustrations".

&nbsp;7.37: Is an Intrigue card which is traded outside the Revolution phase
&nbsp;and placed beneath the board edge subject to selection due to the play
&nbsp;of the Influence Peddling card?
&nbsp;A: Yes, but in this case, it must be returned to the hand prior to the
&nbsp;random draw, and returned beneath the board edge immediately after
&nbsp;regardless of who holds it.

&nbsp;7.4: May a senator not in Rome sponsor games? Can Popularity of a
&nbsp;Senator go above 9?
&nbsp;A: Yes. Yes.

&nbsp;7.511: Do historically opposed statesmen still retain their +7 for
&nbsp;alignment?
&nbsp;A: Yes.

&nbsp;7.511: Is the Flamininus the triggers Cato the Elder's loyalty drop
&nbsp;Flaminius (13) or Flamininus (18A)?
&nbsp;A: 18A. The loyalty drop does not appear on card 18A but it should.

&nbsp;7.511: Is it true that if Statesman A is opposed to Statesman B, that
&nbsp;the reverse is also true?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;9.11 &amp; 9.34: Is the Censor considered the Presiding Magistrate in a
&nbsp;prosecution and thus subject to the loss of one influence if a proposed
&nbsp;prosecution is voted down unanimously?
&nbsp;A: Yes, however the Prosecutor is not subject to any such loss.

&nbsp;9.22: Can a Senator play a tribune to make a proposal to adjourn the
&nbsp;Senate?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;9.24 &amp; 9.91: Can a Senator refuse to be Master of Horse?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;9.34: If the HRAO steps down due to unanimous defeat of his proposal,
&nbsp;does he resign his office, or does he simply pass control of the meeting
&nbsp;to the next HRAO? If the latter, when (if ever) does he become HRAO again?
&nbsp;A: The latter. He doesn't.

&nbsp;9.411: Does a successful Minor Prosecution strip the prosecuted Senator
&nbsp;of any office he is currently holding?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;9.412: Can the Censor name himself Prosecutor?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;9.421: Does an exiled Senator lose Negative popularity also?
&nbsp;A: No. He loses only positive popularity.

&nbsp;9.34: Does a player who proposed a motion with a tribune lose one
&nbsp;influence if the motion is voted down unanimously?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;9.41: May a senator be prosecuted twice for the same offense?
&nbsp;A: No, but he may be prosecuted twice for separate offenses.

&nbsp;9.423: Does the faction that cast the most votes for a Statesman's
&nbsp;return and makes a successful persuasion attempt vs. the Statesman also
&nbsp;get the family card if it belongs to another faction?

&nbsp;A: Yes - even if it is the faction leader.

&nbsp;7.512-514: Persuasion Attempts: Can the persuader use faction treasury
&nbsp;as well as personal treasury to help his attempt? (Both 7.512 and 7.514
&nbsp;read as if he cannot, but the literal reading of 7.513, "_All_ players
&nbsp;may interfere in a Persuasion Attempt ... by spending money from their
&nbsp;Faction Treasuries to aid or resist the Persuasion Attempt", indicates
&nbsp;that he can.). Can non-involved factions spend talents to aid the
&nbsp;persuasion attempt?
&nbsp;A: No. Yes.
&nbsp;(I can't resist editorializing here. Ignore this Q&amp;A. The correct
&nbsp;answers are No, No. A Yes answer to part II opens up horrible rules
&nbsp;rapes. 7.512 and 7.514 should agree with 7.513, in that non-involved
&nbsp;parties may only defend the target senator. Any other ruling would be
&nbsp;illogical).

&nbsp;9.611A: In which phase are concessions destroyed by the 2nd Punic War
&nbsp;or the Gladiator Slave Revolt?
&nbsp;A: The Senate Phase.

&nbsp;9.64: Can the same legion be disbanded and rebuilt during the same
&nbsp;Senate phase?

&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;9.62: Multiple Governorship Elections: If such a package deal is
&nbsp;voted down, are the candidates considered rejected for purposes of the
&nbsp;last-available-candidate rule?
&nbsp;A: Only as part of the same package.

&nbsp;9.64: How is the status of Veteran legions determined when sending
&nbsp;forces to a particular war?
&nbsp;A: If the proposal failed to specify the makeup of the forces, the
&nbsp;commander(s) of the force(s) may chose, dicing for veterans if they
&nbsp;cannot agree.

&nbsp;9.67: Can Consul for Life nominations be made without the use of a
&nbsp;Tribune or the consent of the presiding magistrate?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;9.72: Can a Tribune veto a dictator's appointment or election?
&nbsp;A: No, yes.

&nbsp;9.8: May a faction assassinate one of it's own senators?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;9.83: Are re-rolls for possible capture modified by the played Assassin
&nbsp;and Bodyguard cards?
&nbsp;A: Yes.

&nbsp;9.84: If neither the Censor nor prosecutor are involved in an
&nbsp;assassination, who determines the voting order?
&nbsp;A: The Censor.

&nbsp;9.51: Can more than one Dictator Election be held if the first is
&nbsp;defeated?
&nbsp;A: Yes, but as one does not have to be elected, 9.23 doesn't apply.

&nbsp;9.84: May the FL be an assassin? If so, if the caught assassin is
&nbsp;the Faction Leader, who ia considered the FL for the purpose of the
&nbsp;subsequent prosecution and loss of 5 Influence? What if the faction leader
&nbsp;is not in Rome? Is he recalled to be prosecuted?
&nbsp;A: Yes. No-one. No.

&nbsp;9.92, 10.7: If a Dictator becomes a Proconsul, what happens to his
&nbsp;Master of Horse?
&nbsp;A: He returns to Rome without office.

&nbsp;10.12: If Rome sends a Naval force with no legions, and is victorious in
&nbsp;a naval battle, must the return to Rome or can he remain in the field as
&nbsp;a proconsul and conduct the land war in the next turn?
&nbsp;A: He must return to Rome. By being given no legions he was not
&nbsp;entrusted with the conduct of the land war and has no claim to it.

&nbsp;10.4: When a Naval Battle is won, how much popularity is gained - half
&nbsp;the Naval Strength, or half the Army Strength?
&nbsp;A: Half the Naval strength.

&nbsp;10.4: Leaders &amp; Wars:&nbsp; If Hamilcar and the 1st Punic War are defeated by
&nbsp;Rome before the 2nd Punic War is drawn, is Hamilcar killed immediately
&nbsp;or does he wait around for the 2nd Punic War?
&nbsp;A: The latter, but he must make an aging dr every turn.

&nbsp;10.6: Can the returning legions/fleets be used elsewhere in the same
&nbsp;turn?
&nbsp;A: Yes.

&nbsp;10.7: If a Dictator and Master of Horse both rebel, may they add their
&nbsp;military ratings in the Civil War?
&nbsp;A: Yes.

&nbsp;10.72: ERRATA: The Unrest level is increase by one at the *start* of
&nbsp;every *Population* phase.

&nbsp;10.82: When a commander is captured, when is the ransom paid?
&nbsp;A: Anytime prior to the defeat of the war, or except for barbarian raids
&nbsp;which must be paid before the next forum phase.

&nbsp;10.9: In what order do multiple commanders attack their common war?
&nbsp;A: The order is determined randomly by a dice roll.

&nbsp;11.1: May a player discard a statesman instead of playing/trading it?
&nbsp;A: Yes.

&nbsp;12.1A/12.3: Does a Senator who reaches 35 Influence or is elected Consul
&nbsp;for Life still win if captured by a war on the same turn?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;12.32: Civil War Winner: In the case where a rebel wins conditionally
&nbsp;upon eliminating enough of the remaining war cards, under what
&nbsp;circumstances is his rebellion considered "still ongoing"? Presumably if we
&nbsp;get to invoke this rule at all, the rebel should
&nbsp;already have won the civil war...? i.e., if the rebellion is one of four
&nbsp;ongoing wars, must he still defeat one (to bring the total non-civil
&nbsp;wars down to 2) in order to claim victory?
&nbsp;A: He has not defeated the Senate's army. No ... he could have won
&nbsp;through bankruptcy or people's revolt. Yes.

&nbsp;13.21: May the PM be a priest?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;14.2-.3: Are local taxes that are not sufficient to purchase even one
&nbsp;unit simply lost if not supplemented by the Governor or Senate?
&nbsp;A: Yes.

&nbsp;14.4: Do all bracketed provinces lose all taxes, even though the war
&nbsp;card will only attack one per turn?
&nbsp;A: Yes.

&nbsp;14.41: The rule says Provincial Armies. Does it hold true for fleets
&nbsp;as well?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;14.41-.411: The provincial forces increase the strength of the war, but
&nbsp;are they still removed at double rate?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;14.411: Is the printed strength of a province card which is added to
&nbsp;the strength of a victorious war subject to doubling or tripling for
&nbsp;matching wars?
&nbsp;A: No.

&nbsp;14.413: Provincial Wars: Is there any popularity or influence gain when
&nbsp;a governor defeats a war?
&nbsp;A: Yes - the same as for any military leader.

&nbsp;16.51: Can a player use money to increase his votes as in the regular
&nbsp;game?
&nbsp;A: Not for the purpose of putting together a ruling coalition.

&nbsp;16.51: Is the tie breaker use of money pertaining to the respective
&nbsp;faction treasuries, or all the treasuries of that faction?
&nbsp;A: The latter.

&nbsp;16.76: When would a Neutral use the blackmail/seduction cards?
&nbsp;A: Automatically when dr votes. whatever faction has the most votes
&nbsp;(16.51).

&nbsp;Vatinian Law: The law says that a senator *may* govern by legate.&nbsp; May
&nbsp;he return to the province? When may he leave for/return from the
&nbsp;province? If the province is attacked in his absence, what military
&nbsp;rating is used? When is the senator subject to prosecution/fining for
&nbsp;taking personal income - when he is in Rome, or only when his term has
&nbsp;expired? May he rebel with all of his provinces, or must he choose only
&nbsp;one?&nbsp; If a senator rebels (as a governor or as a commander), what
&nbsp;happens to any provinces he is governing by legate? Do they rebel too,
&nbsp;or do they return to the forum?
&nbsp;A: Yes. He may leave any time during the senate phase, and if he goes,
&nbsp;must remain there until the start of the next senate phase or until
&nbsp;recalled. None. Both. He must chose one. The latter.

&nbsp;Calpurnian Law:&nbsp; What happens to a senator who does not have enough in
&nbsp;his personal treasury to pay the fine?
&nbsp;A: His faction treasury must pay.&nbsp; In unable to, his Popularity and
&nbsp;Influence are reduced by an amount equal to the shortfall.

&nbsp;Cleopatra:&nbsp; Is Cleopatra discarded at the end of the turn, or when the
&nbsp;Alexandrine War is finally defeated?
&nbsp;A: The latter, but is playable only once - once played it stays in play
&nbsp;until the Alexandrine War ends.

&nbsp;Crassus: What income does Crassus double?
&nbsp;A: He doubles only personal revenue and concession income.

&nbsp;Pompey: When is his military rating rolled? Once when played, before
&nbsp;each combat, once a turn, or at some other time? If rolled before
&nbsp;combat, how is minimum force determined in the Senate Phase?
&nbsp;A: Before each combat. His military is considered the minimum of 2.</PRE>
