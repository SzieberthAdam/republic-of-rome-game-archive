New Cards:

--- Intrigue Cards
Assassination Conspiracy - Playable during an assassination attempt to
    prevent the use of ALL bodyguard cards during the attempt. Assassin
    cards can be played to add to the roll. If successful, each of
    the assassinating player's senators loses Popularity and Influence
    equal to half (FRU) of the assassinated senator's Popularity. A
    caught assassin is still killed but the faction leader is immune to
    an assassination prosecution. This card does not in itself add to
    the assassination roll. Can only be played by the player making the
    attempt.

Scandal - Playable during the player's initiative in the Forum Phase.
    Target senator loses DR Popularity. Counts as that player's
    Persuasion Attempt. Discard after use. Not playable versus
    senators with oratory >= 5. The player playing this card must have
    a senator in Rome when this card is played.

The Ultimate Decree - Playable only when Mob Riots is in play
    immediately after a Dictator is assigned. The Dictator gains an
    extra 5 Influence and Tribunes cannot be played for the remainder
    of this turn. Discard the "Mob Riots" event when this card is
    played. The player playing this card must have a senator in Rome
    when this card is played.

Annexation of Egypt - Playable during the Senate Phase to force the
    Senate to vote for the creation of Egypt as a province. The vote
    must occur after all other provinces have been assigned. This vote
    cannot be vetoed and can only occur once in the game. Cannot be
    played if the Alexandrine War has not yet been discarded. If the
    vote passes a governor must be elected to Egypt before any other
    proposals can be made. The player playing this card must have a
    senator in Rome when this card is played.
