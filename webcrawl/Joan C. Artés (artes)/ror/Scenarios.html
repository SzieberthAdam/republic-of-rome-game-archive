Special Rules:
1. Use Middle Republic tables for Legion Loyalty/Random Events in Deck 1
2. Use Late Republic tables for Legion Loyalty/Random Events in Deck 2
3. The 4 Statesman (#1C, #21A, #25B, #27A) that begin the game in Deck 1
   cannot be played prior to Turn 4's Revolution Phase.
4. Renumber the Statesman #1C (Sulla) to #31A. Sulla and Scipio/Cornelius
   are considered to have a Loyalty of 0 when they are in the same
   faction.
5. Land Commissioner begins in play in the Forum. The Land Commissioner
   cannot be assigned or claimed unless there is a Land Bill currently
   in play. #23A may claim the concession (as the card states) if he is
   in Rome as soon as a Land Bill is passed.
6. In PBEM play, cards from Deck 1 and Deck 2 are not distinguishable. A
   Tribune card drawn from Deck 1 looks exactly like a Tribune card drawn
   from Deck 2, for example.
7. Spanish Revolt and Numantine War do not match. Viriathus only matches
   the Spanish Revolt.
8. Scipio (#1B) voids D/S versus 3rd Punic War and Spanish Revolt.
9. Each player can hold up to six cards (instead of five) during the
   Revolution Phase.
10.Clarification: The special abilities of statesman #23A, #25A, #25B
   are not considered Tribunes so cannot be cancelled by Murder of a
   Tribune or Graft.
11.Note that statesman #25A and #25B have loyalty of 0 when on _opposing_
   factions, not the same faction. They prefer to be in the same faction.

Notes: Scipio actually was the victor against the Numantine War; The
Spanish Revolt was ended when Viriathus was murdered. The D/S percentage
for the Spanish Revolt + Viriathus is over 36% so it's best to allow
Scipio to void it. The Spanish Wars (including Sertorian Revolt) should
not match; they should not be comparable to the Mithridatic Wars in
strength. Also, when playing with the Delayed Matching War Rule, not
having them match means they'll become active quicker. Viriathus could be
made to match the Numantine War but then again you'd have a D/S
percentage of over 36% and allowing Scipio to void this war's D/S numbers
as well would make Scipio too strong.
   Allowing Sulla to be played while Cornelius (or Scipio) is controlled
by another player follows from the fact that Lucius Cornelius Cinna was
a rival to Sulla. I view Sulla as sort of a rogue branch of the Cornelii.
No need to add a Statesman to represent Cinna, the Cornelius family card
by itself can represent him.
  Note that whoever is dealt #25 T. Gracchus at the start can play him
since the family card does not begin in play.
