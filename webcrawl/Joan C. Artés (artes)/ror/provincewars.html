* - indicates changes to card
Bithynia- - only attacks undeveloped Bithynia
Bithynia+ - attacks both developed and undeveloped Bithynia (i.e. Bythinia-Pontus)

General Note:
The whole premise for these changes is to keep as close to a "historical" path
as possible while not taking into account that a province may not have existed
at the time of the war.

Specific Changes:
2nd Punic War - switched Narbonese Gaul & Cisalpine Gaul
Syrian War - added Syria & Cilicia-Cyprus; switched Greece & Asia
1st Gallic War - moved Transalpine Gaul; removed Cisalpine Gaul
Germanic Migrations - removed Illyricum; added Narbonese Gaul;
    switched Transalpine Gaul & Cisalpine Gaul
1st Mithridatic War - switched Greece & Asia
3rd Mithridatic War - removed Syria (attack is impossible since defeat of War
    creates Province); added Bithynia
Parthian War - moved Syria to the beginning of the list
2nd Cilician Pirates - added Cilicia-Cyprus & Crete-Cyrene (both appear on Province
    cards, text probably cut off on War card due to lack of space)
2nd Gallic War - switched Transalpine Gaul & Cisalpine Gaul
3rd Gallic War - switched Transalpine Gaul & Cisalpine Gaul
