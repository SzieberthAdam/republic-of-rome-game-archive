Early Republic Strategies (for the good of Rome)

These strategies are primarily useful when playing an Extended Game where
a triple-strength War can be a big problem. When playing just the Early
Republic, it might be possible to ignore the Punic Wars altogether.

I. Play Scipio
If Scipio can be played right at the start, he should be played. If
another player controls Scipio but not Cornelius, then he should trade or
give Scipio to the player controlling Cornelius so that he can be played
during the first Revolution Phase. Though Scipio can't be elected Consul
on the first turn (if Cornelius is in play as well) he can be appointed
Dictator if the situation arises. It would be a shame to not make use of
his abilities on the first turn. In my opinion an Active 1st Punic War is
enough to activate a Dictator as I would add the Land and Fleet strengths
together (a 10/5/10 war is more dangerous than a 20/0 war in my opinion
and the Dictator is there for emergencies). Fabius Maximus and the other
Military Statesman would also be very helpful if played ASAP like Scipio.

II. Prosecution of Cornelius/Scipio
A Cornelius/Scipio who becomes Censor during the first Senate Phase
should be prosecuted on turn 1 or 2 with a minor prosecution. If not his
influence could easily rise over 21 causing a very bad political climate
at the time when Rome cannot afford one. He can propose to target himself
for prosecution. He can select as prosecutor one of his own low-military
Senators so that he gets to keep the Prior Consul marker and loses only 2
net Influence. A Cornelius/Scipio who is Dictator should probably not be
prosecuted unless the players want a possible -5 to the next Population
Roll!

III. Contributions
All players should contribute generously to the State during the first
Revenue Phase. A total of 28 to 38 talents is recommended in order to get
the State Revenue to 220 or 230. If the players like they can make an
enforceable Open Deal at the beginning of each turn stating that no
Censor will prosecute a Senator that controls a Concession if all the
money generated by that Concession is contributed to the State. I would
suggest that such a deal last only for the current turn.

IV. 1st Punic War
If no Wars were drawn on the first turn (or maybe only minor ones), and
Scipio can be sent to fight it; I would suggest attacking the 1st Punic
War with as many forces as can be mustered, spending the entire treasury
if need be! Which War to attack is really dependent on lots of factors so
you can't really plan ahead.

V. Provincial Wars (Advanced Game Only)
Defeat of these Wars create Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum. The 2nd Punic
War can attack Gaul and the Macedonian Wars can attack Illyricum. This
could be bad or good depending on how strong the province is. It might be
possible to attack these Wars using the Province (a Victory would make
the War either inactive or reshuffled). The Provincial Forces and Printed
Strength will add to the Roman Force sent to garrison the province. One
problem is that the Governor could revolt since all the garrisons are
automatically loyal to him (no legion loyalty roll needed) though they do
require maintenance.

VI. Force Size
Always try to attack with a +11 (or +10) combat bonus since that would
*guarantee* a victory without taking into account D/S numbers. Some of
the money spent for the extra legions will be reclaimed by the Victory.
For instance, Victory against the Syrian War or 2nd Macedonian War will
result in a positive 65 talent swing in the state's treasury. Buying lots
early will also help lessen the effects of a Manpower Shortage.

VII. Armaments and Ship Building
Don't look at these cards as being bad for Rome. They should be played
ASAP! The revenue generated from these cards can be contributed to the
State giving an effective 20% discount for Legion Purchase and a 30%
discount for Fleet Purchase. Make an Open Deal if you are worried about
being prosecuted for playing one of these cards.

VIII. Matching Wars
It's pretty important to defeat at least 1 Punic War and 1 Macedonian War
before you enter the Middle Period. Otherwise, you risk facing triple-
strength (or quadruple-strength) Wars fairly easily!
